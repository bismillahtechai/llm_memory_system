It's Ali, and welcome. This is the first video of the week one's awareness module. And we're gonna start with the model that I have of the brain that I have been using, that I have developed a long time ago, that has been serving me really, really well. This is a model that not only I personally use, this is something I have learned from studying people like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Leonardo Da Vinci.\r\n\r\nI've studied a lot of people, many of them billionaires, self made billionaires, and I try to understand what made them different from other people. I also studied other great artists, entrepreneurs, and engineers throughout history, and for example, Leonardo Da Vinci would stand out to me very often, and when I distilled everything that these entrepreneurs, artists, engineers, physicists, investors, inventors had in common, it came down to these four things that they all really had in common. So if you came here directly, into this coaching program without having first gone through my productivity system, my ADHD system, that's basically the very top layer.\r\n\r\nRight? Like, the systems I use, my to do list, my calendar, how I organize my phone, how I organize my computer, kind of external systems that I build in place. That's what you see on the top. That's kind of what what you see on the outside.\r\n\r\nYou can think of this as kind of like the tip of the iceberg.\r\n\r\nIt's a little tip over here, and then like, at the absolute bottom, there's like a massive thing happening.\r\n\r\nAnd this massive thing happening are three other things that most people do not see. Because they're kind of hidden behind behind the water. And the systems on the very top are extremely important, don't get me wrong. Like having, for example, personal productivity system is important.\r\n\r\nHaving, companies, a company as a system, hiring the right people, that's a system. External systems are extremely important. But external systems are not the thing that is gonna make you wildly successful and get the life you want. And again, my definition of successful is not necessarily you make a lot of money or you go get some type of recognition or not.\r\n\r\nMy definition of successful is getting what you truly want in life. But here's the problem. To get what you truly want in life, you need to develop the awareness of what you actually want in life. You need to understand, what do I even want in life, and why do I want it?\r\n\r\nSo I'm gonna quickly run you through this diagram and this model of the mind. Basically, this is what's going on as the, I want you to look at this and adopt it as your new operating manual.\r\n\r\nSo right below systems sits something called cognition. Cognition is basically your ability to use brain, your your brain, in a conscious way, your ability to make decisions, your ability to learn new information. So this is basically how your brain processes like new and incoming information, and what you do with that information. From a software perspective, these are like the functions that are written inside your brain that help you kind of figure out what to do with these things as as things are thrown at you.\r\n\r\nThis is your decision making. And decision making is an extremely important skill. It is the most important skill because your life is made of all the decisions that you make. Right?\r\n\r\nEvery single day you make decisions. And obviously your decisions will be influenced by the system they have in place, but at the end of the day, your decisions are actually determined by your internal judgment. Right? And your internal judgment comes from a deep layer, a layer deeper, which is your mindset.\r\n\r\nRight? Now, mindset is what I like to think of as your beliefs.\r\n\r\nSo where cognition is more of functions, like things you do, like make a decision, take an action, learn something. It's usually verbs, actions that happen in cognition.\r\n\r\nMindset is more about data that is stored in your brain. That's your beliefs. For example, I have a personal belief that I love electrical engineering. Right?\r\n\r\nAnd that belief causes me to act in a way that makes me want to go learn electronics, makes me go want to work on an antenna that looks something like that, makes me want to go learn software, makes me want to do all these things. Now, independent of whether that belief is true or not, I'm always gonna act in accordance with my belief. Belief. Right?\r\n\r\nSo even though we mentioned that the cognition, the decisions that you make are influenced by the systems that you have outside of your brain, they actually derive from your mindset, which is your beliefs inside your brain. Now, how do you change those beliefs? How do you even become aware those beliefs exist? Well, bingo.\r\n\r\nThis is why the most bottom most layer, I don't even know if that's a word, bottom most layer, at the bottom is awareness.\r\n\r\nThis is the fundamental thing. If you lack awareness, you are screwed. None of this will matter.\r\n\r\nYou won't know what your beliefs are, you won't know what beliefs to adopt, you won't know what decisions you're making or whether the decisions you're making are better or not. And you probably won't even notice that there's environment, and systems, and things that are altering your day to day behavior.\r\n\r\nSo we start with awareness for a very good reason, is that awareness is at the root. I'm not here to waste your time, I'm here to get your results from week one. And the way to do we do that is we start with awareness. We're gonna aggressively tackle awareness. Then in week two, we're gonna address mindset, beliefs, we're gonna figure out what beliefs we want to adopt, install that new code inside your brain. Once we do that, then we're gonna learn about cognition. We're gonna understand, okay, now with the new awareness that we have and the new beliefs that we have in mind, let's think about the decisions that we have to make.\r\n\r\nAnd once we have all that, then we can go back and revisit the systems that we have. But then in week four, we install new systems. Right? And then these systems are gonna break, this whole thing's gonna break.\r\n\r\nSo in week five, we discuss failure systems. What happens when things go wrong? How do you detect which one here went wrong? Right?\r\n\r\nSo I got you. This whole thing, this is my life's best work. I spent five years doing a PhD from the time I was twenty one until I was twenty six. I've done a lot of great, I've designed great antennas, I've built great electronics.\r\n\r\nThis six week program, program, the way I've designed it, in my opinion, really just attacks all the problems and is built with an engineer's mindset. It is so robust. I'm just so excited for you. So now that we understand what the model looks like and how this model, leads to the progression of the model, how this model, leads to the progression of the program, let's go ahead and dive a little bit into awareness.\r\n\r\nNow,\r\n\r\nThe difference between people who are aware and the people who are not aware is that aware people ask a lot more questions on average. So you can judge how aware someone is just by their ability to notice things and ask questions regarding these things. And very simple examples can be like, something happens and you're like, why did that happen? Or like, why did that person do that?\r\n\r\nOr like, why did this thing break?\r\n\r\nOr why did this thing happen?\r\n\r\nThis thing break? Or why\r\n\r\ndid this thing happen?\r\n\r\nMajority of people who are not aware or not very conscious, don't even notice things in the first place, and if they do notice them, they don't question them. They don't ask why is this thing thing thing happening? What's going on here? So the very first thing we we we have to understand is that awareness starts with asking questions.\r\n\r\nIf you're not asking enough questions in your life, and and these questions are not driven by curiosity, you're inherently gonna be in a very low awareness state. Right? Now, I wanna also show you something that is very very interesting about the mind. So now that we have figured out this model, and we have agreed that awareness, which sits at the bottom, is the thing that matters the most, I wanna introduce you to something.\r\n\r\nAnd this is again something I had to learn from, engineers at NASA, engineers at SpaceX, from reading a lot of books, just from thinking very deeply about life, from asking a lot of questions about life, about career, about things of that nature. What I came to also realize is that what I showed you is kind of an in information, based model of the mind. How the mind processes data and transfers data between different layers. Those are kind of the layers of the mind. But what I also wanna show you something even simpler that most people do not understand, is that your mind can be simply broken down to this.\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nThis is my best attempt at drawing a man on a horse, okay? My drawing skills are not great, they're not nearly as great as my other skills, but but the idea is that this is a man on a horse, and this is your mind. Right? Most people don't know this, but there's actually two people inside of you. There is you, and then there is the other you.\r\n\r\nBut one of you is a human, and the other one is a horse. And what I mean by that is that there are two people inside of every human.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what makes humans different from animals. Animals don't have this. Animals only have the horse, hence it's the horse. But a human has a human and a horse. Right? And the idea is that every single one of us has a conscious being.\r\n\r\nPeople who are more spiritual will call this like your soul, or whatever gives you a conscious awareness.\r\n\r\nI I like to call that part the human. Like what makes you actually human, what makes you conscious, what makes you aware. But then, we also have the horse.\r\n\r\nThe machine.\r\n\r\nThe the thing that we have in common with other animals. The thing that makes us biologically in tune with other animals.\r\n\r\nAnd this thing is basically driven by a lot of instant gratification and short term desires, and this thing is trying to self actualize and trying to reach full potential and trying to live life to the fullest. And the tragedy is that unless you come to the awareness that you are a man on a horse or a woman on a horse, without the awareness, the man or woman does not exist. You are only a horse. And what I mean by that is that you have to come to ask, why do I do the things that I do? And why are my patterns this way? And why are my tendencies this way? And you'll be very quick to realize a lot of your habits, patterns, behaviors are not things that you chose.\r\n\r\nThey're determined by your genetics, but more importantly, they're determined by the environment that you grew up in. You likely inherited the same beliefs your parents did, or your uncles did, or your friends in high school, middle school, elementary school, especially early on in childhood.\r\n\r\nAll these things basically formed your immediate patterns and tendencies. See, there's these are the things that shaped your horse. But then your horse also has your neurophysiology built into it, which is your dopamine circuits, your norepinephrine circuits, your serotonin circuits. And these are just fancy ways of saying that you're always gonna seek things because the horse inside of you wants them.\r\n\r\nThis is why you want food. This is why you want to procreate. You want to do these other things. So until the man first realizes that he's on a horse, and until the man knows that he's in control of the horse, and he can redirect the horse to which whoever wherever he wants, it's gonna be near impossible to go anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where, in my honest opinion, a lot of modern psychology has failed. And this is why I like to use a systems engineering approach to attack the brain and solve the brain, and do things like mindset and productivity and things of that nature. Because a lot of psychologists, do not like this model. They think that man is man, man, horse being one thing.\r\n\r\nThere's just one thing. But I'm gonna prove to you that there's two people inside of you because words like self esteem and self respect stem from this relationship. Right? Your self respect or your self esteem, your ability to look at yourself is very often driven by your behavior.\r\n\r\nIt's driven by your ability to control the horse. If you're controlling the horse very well, you're going to sleep on time, you're eating healthy, you're making progress on your business, you're making progress on your career, you're feeling confident, you're you have clear boundaries with people. If you're able to steer the ship, or the machine, or the horse very well, you feel really good about yourself. The the conscious human inside of you feels good, feels enlightened, feels closer to the goals and potential.\r\n\r\nNow, if you have one night where you're just kind of binge watching Netflix, binge eating fast food, just kind of doing whatever, spending days on your phone, making zero progress on your goal, guess who's in control here?\r\n\r\nIt's the horse. The conscious being is like totally out of out of the loop. But the conscious being is always observing.\r\n\r\nThis is why you feel bad about yourself when you're doing things that only satisfy the horse, because this guy's always watching.\r\n\r\nThere's two parts of you. One guy's always acting, but one guy's always watching. And when that guy is not liking what he is watching, or she is watching, there's gonna be low self esteem, and there's gonna be a hit in self confidence. Right? So what I want you to understand is every pattern, every behavior, every tendency that you have in your life, while you did not choose it, and someone else likely chose it for you, you can choose to wake up and make a decision that you're gonna choose how you're gonna steer this horse, or ship, or machine.\r\n\r\nAnd in order for you to do that, you're gonna need to develop the awareness.\r\n\r\nAnd later in a few videos, we're gonna talk about awareness systems, things that you can do to increase your awareness. But by now, what I want you to understand is that just by the power of being more aware alone, you hold the key to change your life. Because it is through awareness that you're able to figure out what this guy wants. And once this guy knows what he wants, and he understands how he has an, as an entity operates, he can steer the other part of him or her to get to the destination that they want. \n\r\nAnalysis and Comparison:\r\n\r\nAnalyze the four-layer model of the mind presented in the transcript: Awareness, Mindset, Cognition, and Systems. Examine how these concepts align with or differ from Islamic principles related to self-awareness (Taqwa), intention (Niyyah), reason ('Aql), and action (Amal), respectively.\r\n\r\nThe transcript emphasizes the critical role of awareness in self-improvement. Identify specific Islamic teachings that highlight the importance of self-reflection, introspection, and awareness of one's actions and intentions.\r\n\r\nAnalyze the \"Man on a Horse\" analogy. In what ways can this model be understood in the context of Islamic teachings about the battle between the soul (nafs) and the intellect (aql)? How does it align with concepts like the \"nafs al-ammarah\" (the soul that commands evil), the \"nafs al-lawwamah\" (the self-reproaching soul), and the \"nafs al-mutma'innah\" (the soul at peace)?\r\n\r\nThe presenter suggests that much of one's habits and tendencies are influenced by external factors and genetics. Compare this to Islamic views on individual accountability, free will, and the influence of environment and society on personal development.\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"systems\" is explored in the transcript. How can an Islamic perspective inform the construction of personal systems and routines that promote spiritual growth and overall well-being?\r\n\r\nHow do the ideas about self-esteem and self-respect, arising from the \"man's\" ability to steer the \"horse\", intersect with Islamic concepts of self-worth, dignity, and the pursuit of divine pleasure?\r\n\r\nBased on the analysis above, provide a concrete actionable plan for how a Muslim could implement the identified Islamic principles in their daily life for the purpose of strengthening self-awareness, refining their mindset, improving their decisions, and building effective and beneficial systems.\r\n\r\nExpected Output:\r\n\r\nProvide a detailed analysis and comparison that clearly highlights how the concepts in the transcript relate to Islamic principles, supported by references to relevant Quranic verses, Hadith, or Islamic scholarship where appropriate. Provide concrete action steps based in Islamic principles on how to implement these ideas."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"90174662dd22fa27-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4eb360b1-fc0a-409f-9f80-c5dc188b9c21","children":["4ce1c8d0-081b-4f55-bae3-952b7b7a340d"]},"4ce1c8d0-081b-4f55-bae3-952b7b7a340d":{"id":"4ce1c8d0-081b-4f55-bae3-952b7b7a340d","message":{"id":"4ce1c8d0-081b-4f55-bae3-952b7b7a340d","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736791184.808063,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_browsing_display","result":"","summary":"","assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa27f01-87a3-466b-87b1-981fb0e26476","request_id":"90174662dd22fa27-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa27f01-87a3-466b-87b1-981fb0e26476","children":["0abf17a2-50d8-4ef8-b070-b28e8663dad4"]},"0abf17a2-50d8-4ef8-b070-b28e8663dad4":{"id":"0abf17a2-50d8-4ef8-b070-b28e8663dad4","message":{"id":"0abf17a2-50d8-4ef8-b070-b28e8663dad4","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736791184.808345,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-WQ0rSYRdzjznQji762RU7fTa","domain":"the-lawful-and-the-prohibited-in-islam (1).pdf","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nR\nR\n \n\nN\nE\nP\n \nO\nU\n \n\nO\nE\n \nN\nN\n \n\nPEC CECECECECL LES \n\nDat Ws an we A 2 Y bse d Se 2 Ye 0s: POA WW, 8: \n\nE rr\n e re ie\n \n\no)\n \n\nG\n za\n 4 = fo)\n \n\nzZ\n \n\nSheikh Yusuf al-Qarad \n\nOM, x ‘ \n\nawit \n\n\n\nCONTENTS \n\nINTRODUCTION ou... cece eecccceecceeeseceeeeeecesseeeenaeeeeues XIX \n\nDefinitions ...........cc.cecccceecseececeeecneeceeceueeeeeeseoeeeees XXIX \n\nCHAPTER ONE \n\nTHE ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES PERTAINING \n\nTO THE LAWFUL AND THE PROHIBITED \n\n1.

It is not for any human to decide what is lawful and what 1S \n\nprohibited. not even the Prophet (pbuh) through his own personal judgments \n\nthat depend on no Divine source. No body has the authority to declare any \n\nfood, drink, dress, or trade and business as lawful or prohibited. Moreover, it \n\nis one of the striking features of Islam that all human beings, whatever the \n\nclass or rank they enjoy, are equal before halal and haram injunctions. \n\nThere is no double standard in the Shari‘ah. \n\nThe only criterion for defining the halal or the haram is the Qur'anic \n\ninjunctions revealed from Allah, the Creator, Who knows what benefits man \n\nmost, as well as the authenticated Prophetic Sunnah, as it is based on a \n\nDivine revelation. \n\nTo define the halal and the haram is not an easy matter. Many Muslim \n\nImams and scholars hesitate to handle such matters. When Sheikh Yusuf \n\nal-Qaradawi shouldered this responsibility, he knew well how much \n\ndifficulty he had put on himself. However, he managed to present a book, which \n\nis small in size yet great in value. It contains moderate legal judgements that \n\nmeet the needs of man in the contemporary changing circumstances. \n\nAl-Falah feels indebted to Sheikh al-Qaradawi, first for giving it the \n\nchance to present this valuable work to our English-speaking readers in a \n\nprevious edition and secondly for allowing the publishing of a second \n\nedition of it. This second edition is supposed to be better with respect to the \n\npreparation, translation, formatting, and revision, and the Foundation hopes \n\nit will secure an easier understanding of this prominent work. \n\nFinally, all praise and thanks are due to Allah, without Whose help and \n\nguidance nothing can be accomplished. \n\nAL Falah Director \n\nMuhammad ‘Abdu\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Department of Islamic Culture of Al-Azhar University requested me \n\nto contribute in an academic undertaking to write easily readable books or \n\npamphlets which, when translated into English, should introduce Islam and \n\nits teachings to Europe and America, educating the Muslims who reside \n\nthere and attracting the non-Muslims toward Islam. \n\nCertainly, this assignment to produce books and pamphlets has both a \n\nlofty aim and a broad scope. It should have been initiated long ago, since, \n\nmany Muslims in Europe and America have very little knowledge of Islam, \n\nand even that little is not safe from distortion and confusion. Recently a \n\nfriend from Al-Azhar who was sent to the United States of America wrote to \n\nus, saying, \"Many Muslims in this state run bars and earn their living \n\nthrough the sale of liquor, not even knowing that this is a major sin in \n\nIslam.\" He adds, \"Muslim men marry Christian, Jewish and sometimes \n\nmushrik women, passing over the Muslim women, who remain unmarried \n\nand have to fend for themselves.\" \n\nIf this is the condition of the Muslims, what about the non-Muslims? \n\nPeople in the West have a very distorted and ugly picture of Islam, its \n\nProphet (pbuh) and its followers, a picture painted by Christian missionaries \n\nand the representatives of the imperialist powers. They have used all means \n\nof propaganda at their disposal to malign Islam and to prejudice the minds \n\nof people against it, while we, at the same time have been heedless and \n\nneglectful of combating this malicious propaganda. \n\nIt is indeed high time to launch an educational project in order to remedy \n\nthis situation, to inform people about the truth of Islam, and to invite them to \n\nit. We welcome this blessed step, commending these devoted people of \n\nAl-Azhar; we request them to redouble their efforts in this direction, and \n\npray to Allah ever to bless and help them. \n\nep\n\n\n\nThe Department of Islamic Culture assigned me the task of writing on \nthe subject of the lawful (halal) and the prohibited (haram) in Islam, \nrequesting that I present the subject in a simple and easily understandable \nmanner which was also to include a comparison with other religions and \ncultures. \n\nAt first glance the subject of the lawful and the prohibited may seem \neasy to write about, but it is, in fact, extremely difficult. No previous author, \nwhether early or modern, has compiled a book specifically treating this \ntopic. The researcher will find material pertaining to this subject scattered \nthroughout various chapters in the books on Islamic Jurisprudence (Figh), \nand between the lines in the commentaries of the Qur'an and in the books of \n\nthe Prophet's hadiths. \n\nSuch a subject, moreover, compels the writer to be precise concerning \nmany matters about which earlier scholars differed and over which \ncontemporary scholars are confused. Consequently, to prefer one opinion to \nanother in matters relating to the halal and the haram in Islam requires \npatience, thoroughness in research, and intellectual exertion on the part of \nthe researcher, all this after he has cleared his heart of all desires except that \nof pleasing Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and to seek the truth. \n\nIt is my observation that most contemporary researchers and writers on \nIslam fall under one of two groups. The vision of one group has been \nblurred by the glamor of Western civilization. Overawed by this great idol, \nthey worship it, approach it imploringly, and stand before it humbly, with \ndowncast eyes, accepting Western principles and customs as unassailable \n\nand proven beyond doubt. Accordingly, if one aspect of Islam is agreeable \nthey accept it while if another opposes them, they try to find similarities and \nagreements, offer excuses and apologies, or resort to far-fetched \nexplanations and distortions, as if Islam had no choice except to surrender to \nthe philosophy and customs of Western civilization. When we examine their \nviews, we find that they permit things which Islam has prohibited, such as: \nstatues, lotteries, interest, privacy with a non-mahram woman, a man’s \n\nwearing gold and silk, and so on. They frown upon things which Islam has \npermitted, such as divorce and polygamy, as if, in their view, whatever is \nlegal in the West is halal and whatever is illegal is haram. They forget that\n\n\n\nIslam is the word of Allah and that His word is always uppermost. Islam \n\ncame to be followed, and not to follow; to be dominant, and not subordinate. \n\nHow can the Lord of men follow men and how can the Creator submit to the \n\nwhims of His creatures? \n\n@[f the truth had been in accord with their desires, the heavens and the \n\nearth, and all therein, would have been in corruption ... ® \n\n(Al-Mu'minun: 71) \n\n@ Say. Is there among your partners (whom you associate with Allah) \n\nany who guides to the truth? Say: Allah guides to the truth. Then does \n\nHe who guides to the truth have more right to be obeyed, or the one who \n\nis not guided unless he receives guidance? Then what is wrong with you \n\nall? How do you judge? & \n\n(Yunus: 35) \n\nThe other group is frozen in its fixed opinions concerning questions \n\nabout the halal and the haram, following a statement in a text which they \n\nassume to be Islam. They do not budge a hair's breadth from their position, \n\nnor do they try to weigh their opinion against the arguments of others, and to \n\narrive at the truth after a comparison and critical evaluation of opinions. If \n\none of them were to be asked his opinion concerning music, singing, chess, \n\nwomen's education, a woman's showing her face and hands, and similar \n\nmatters, the most likely answer would be haram. This group has forgotten \n\nthe caution exercised by our righteous forebears in such matters, who never \n\napplied the word haram to anything unless they knew it to be definitely \n\nprohibited. If there were the slightest doubt about the matter they would \n\nonly say, \"We disapprove of it\" or \"We do not like it,\" or some other \n\nsimilarly mild statements. \n\n| have endeavored to follow neither. I cannot compromise my religion by \n\ntaking the West as my god after accepting Allah as the Lord, Islam as the \n\nreligion, and Muhammad (pbuh) as the Messenger. At the same time, | \n\ncannot compromise my intellect by following one particular school of \n\njurisprudence in all its judgements, right or wrong, suspending my own \n\nreasoning faculty and discernment. \"A blind follower,\" in the words of Ibn \n\nal-Jawzi, \"does not have any trust in what he follows. To imitate is to \n\nsuspend the use of the intellect, whereas the intellect is created for thinking\n\n\n\nand reasoning. It is stupidity for a person given a light to show him the way, \nonly to extinguish it and walk in darkness.\"“!? \n\nThis is why I have not confined myself to any one of the several schools \n\nof jurisprudence (madhahib, singular madhhab) prevalent in the Islamic \nworld, for the truth is not the monopoly of any one’s school. The leading \n\nscholars of these schools never claimed that they were infallible; they were, \n\nin fact, researchers who sought to know the truth. If they erred in a ruling \nthey would have a reward, and if they were correct, their reward would be \n\ntwice as great. \n\nImam Malik said, \"The word of any person other than the Prophet (pbuh) \nis sometimes acceptable and sometimes objectionable.\" And Imam Shafi'i \n\ncommented, \"My opinion is correct with the possibility of its being \n\nerroneous. An opinion different from mine could be erroneous and could be \n\ncorrect.” \n\nWhile it is not worthy of a Muslim scholar who is capable of comparing \n\nand choosing to tie himself to a single school of jurisprudence or to submit \n\nto the opinion of a particular jurist; he must give weight to arguments and \n\nproofs. The jurist with stronger arguments and a valid proof deserves to be \n\nfollowed, while the one with weaker arguments and stale proofs should be \n\nrejected, regardless of whomever he is. On this point, Imam “Ali said, \n\n\"Truth is not to be learned on the basis of authority. Learn the truth and then \n\nyou will know who the truthful ones are.\" \n\nI have tried, to the best of my ability, to follow the guidelines of the \n\nDepartment of Islamic Culture. Thus I have presented material supported by \n\narguments, proofs, and comparisons, employing the latest scientific ideas \n\nand contemporary ideas. Praise be to Allah, Islam is like the radiant sun, \n\nwhose light bears the proof that it is an eternal religion for all mankind. \n\n(Our religion) takes its hue from Allah, and who can give a better hue € g g \nthan Allah?... & \n\n(Al-Bagqarah: 138) \n\nThe concept of the lawful and the prohibited has been known to every \n\nnation since ancient times. However, people have differed in defining the \n\n1.

Then came the \n\ndivinely revealed religions,” with their laws and injunctions concerning the \n\nhalal and the haram, uplifting mankind from the level of superstition, myth, \n\nand tribalism to the level of dignity which befits a human existence. \n\nHowever, in the religions revealed prior to Islam there existed some \n\nprohibitions and permissions which were legislated for a temporary period, \n\nin relation to the specific conditions of the people and their environment. \n\nFor example, Allah prohibited some lawful things to the Children of Israel \n\nas a punishment for their rebellious attitude; thereafter, Prophet “Isa (peace \n\nbe upon him) told the people that he had come \n\n@... confirming the truth of what was before me of the Tawrah and to \n\nmake lawful to you some of what was prohibited to you... ® \n\n(Al “Imran: 50) \n\nFinally, when mankind had reached the stage of intellectual maturity and \n\nwas ready to receive the last message from Allah (Glory be to Him), Islam \n\ncame with its complete, comprehensive, and eternal Shari ‘ah (law) for the \n\nwhole of mankind. Concerning this, after mentioning what He has \n\nprohibited as food, Allah says, \n\n&... This day I have perfected your religion for you and have completed \n\nMy favour upon you, and have chosen Islam for you as religion... » \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 3) \n\nIslam's view of the halal and the haram is very simple and clear. It is a \n\npart of that great trust which Allah offered to the heavens, the earth, and the \n\nmountains, which they declined but which man accepted. This trust requires \n\nman to carry out the duties placed on him by Allah as His vicegerent on \n\nearth and to assume _ accountability concerning them. This responsibility is \n\n1. According to the Qur'an there has been only one true, authentic faith; Islam. Islam means the at- \n\ntainment of peace through conscientious and loving submission to the Will and Guidance of Al- \n\nlah. This was the mission of all Prophets and Messengers in human history. It is the same funda- \n\nmental faith which was revealed to Prophets Musa, “Isa, and Muhammad (peace be upon them). \n\nThe original revelations given to Musa and “Isa are no longer available in their complete, origi- \n\nnal. and unadulterated form. The Qur'an is the only divine revelation that is meticulously pre- \n\nserved in its complete, original, and unadulterated form. As such, it is to be used as the criterion \n\nto judge the authenticity of the present form of previous revelations. \n\n\n\nthe basis on which the human individual will be judged by Allah and given \nWis reward or punishment. Because of this trust, Allah gave man intellect, \n\nwill, power, and freedom of choice; because of this, He sent His messengers \n\nand revealed His Books. It is not for man to question, \"Why is there halal \nand haram? Why am I not left free to do as I please?\" for this is precisely \nthe test of his freedom of choice and action. Moreover, man is neither a \npurely spiritual being like the angels nor simply a creature of instinct like \nthe animals. Rather he occupies a position between the two: he can attain or \neven surpass the spiritual heights of the angels, or he can sink to the level of \nthe beasts, or even lower. \n\nFrom another perspective, the halal and the haram are part of the total \nlegal system of Islam, its Shari‘ah, a system whose primary objective is the \ngood of mankind. The Islamic Shariah removes from human beings \nharmful, burdensome customs and superstitions, aiming to simplify and ease \nthe business of day-to-day living. Its principles are meant to protect man \nfrom evil and for him to benefit all aspects of his life. And they are meant to \nbenefit everyone in the community - rich or poor, ruler or ruled, man or \nwoman - as well as to benefit the whole of humanity all over the world in \nvarious countries and climes, with its multitudinous groupings, and in every \nperiod of time throughout succeeding generations. \n\nThis religion came as a mercy from Allah to include all his servants in \nthe final stage among the various stages of man. Concerning His Messenger \n(pbuh) Allah says, \n\n@ And We have not sent thee except as a mercy for all the worlds. & \n\n(Al-Anbiya’: 107) \n\nAnd the Prophet (pbuh) himself said, \n\n\"Lama merciful gift.\" \n\nOne aspect of this mercy is that Allah removed from the Muslim Ummah \nall traces of fanaticism and zealotry, and the signs of the alleged lawfulness \nand prohibition that the idolaters and the People of the Book (Jews and \nChristians) made as part of life, as they prohibited the good things and \npermitted the foul. Allah says, \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Hakim on the authority of Abu Hurayrah, Adh-Dhahabi said that this hadith is \nauthentic.\n\n\n\n@... My mercy embraces all things. Thus I shall ordain it for those who \n\nare conscious (of Me) and who give the purifying alms (Zakah), and \n\nthose who believe in Our revelations. ® \n\n(Al-A*raf: 156) \n\nThe Islamic criteria with regard to the halal and the Aaram — are \n\nembodied in the following two Qur'anic verses, \n\n@ Say: Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has brought \n\nforth for His servants, and the good things of His providing? Say: They \n\nare, on the Day of Resurrection, exclusively for those who believed \n\nduring the life of this world. Thus do We explain the signs for those who \n\nknow. Say: What my Lord has indeed prohibited are shameful deeds, \n\nwhether open or secret, and sin and rebellion without just cause, and that \n\nyou associate with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, \n\nand that you say concerning Allah that about which you do not know. ® \n\n(ALA raf: 32-33) \n\nIn view of the fact that the halal and the haram constitute such an important \n\nsubject, I believe that this book, in spite of its modest size, will fill a gap in \n\nthe library of the contemporary Muslim, that it will solve many problems \n\nwhich he faces in his personal, family, and social life; and that it will answer \n\nmany questions of this kind: What is permitted to him? What is prohibited to \n\nhim? And what is the reason for permitting this and prohibiting that? \n\nIn bringing this introduction to a close, I would like to express my thanks \n\nto the scholars of Al-Azhar and the Department of Islamic Culture for \n\nplacing their trust in me to deal with such a vital subject. I hope I have \n\nproven worthy of their trust and have achieved their objective. \n\nI pray Allah (Glory be to Him) to benefit those who read this book, grant \n\nus truthfulness in what we say and do, preserve our thoughts and our pens \n\nfrom deviation, and guide us in all our affairs. It is He alone Who hears to \n\nsupplication. \n\nYusn al-Qaradaui \n\nSafar 1380 / August 1960\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Definitions \n\nAl-Halal (The lawful): \n\nThat which is permitted, with respect to which no \n\nrestriction exists, and the doing of which the \n\nLaw-Giver, Allah, has allowed. \n\nAl-Haram (The prohibited): \n\nThat which the Law-Giver has absolutely prohibited; \n\nanyone who commits it is liable to incur the \n\npunishment of Allah in the Hereafter as well as a \n\nlegal punishment in this world. \n\nAl-Makruh (The detestable): \n\nThat which is disapproved by the Law-Giver but not \n\nvery strongly.

The Haram Is Prohibited to Everyone Alike. \n\n11. Necessity Dictates Exceptions. \n\n\n\nThe Islamic Principles Pertaining \n\nto the Lawful and the Prohibited \n\nThe question of what ought to be halal (lawful) and haram (prohibited) \n\nwas one of the matters concerning which, prior to the advent of Is]am, the \n\nnations of the world had gone very far astray and were utterly confused, \n\npermitting many impure and harmful things and prohibiting many \n\nthings that were good and pure. \n\nThey erred grievously, going either far to the right or far to the left. On \n\nthe extreme right was the ascetic Brahmanism of India and the self-denying \n\nmonasticism of Christianity. In addition to these two, there were other \n\nreligions which were based on the principles of the mortification of the \n\nflesh, abstention from good food, and avoidance of other enjoyments of life \n\nwhich Allah has provided for human beings. Christian monasticism attained \n\nits peak during the Middle Ages when the avoidance of good and pure \n\nthings among the monks, thousands in number, reached the point at which \n\nwashing one's feet was considered a sin and taking a bath was something to \n\nregret and repent. On the extreme left, the Mazdak philosophy emerged in \n\nPersia, advocating absolute freedom and allowing people to take whatever \n\nthey wanted and to do whatever they pleased, even exhorting them to \n\nviolate what is naturally held inviolable by human beings. \n\nThe Arabs of the pre-Islamic era provide a noteworthy example of utter \n\nconfusion regarding the criteria for making lawful or prohibiting things and \n\nactions. They permitted the drinking of alcohol, the taking of usury at \n\nexorbitant rates, the torturing and secluding of women, and many similar \n\npractices. Those who had diabolical minds allured most of them to the killing \n\nof their own children, until, suppressing their natural paternal feelings, they \n\nobeyed them. As Allah (Glory be to Him) says, \n\n& Thus have their partners made alluring to many of the idolaters the \n\nkilling of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction, \n\nC3». \nVi \n\n\n\nand to confound for them their religion... te \n\n(Al-An’am: 137) \n\nThese \"partners\" from among the guardians of the idols had devised \nmany impressive arguments to persuade fathers to kill their own children: \namong them were the fear of actual or anticipated poverty, the impending \n\nshame in the case of a daughter, and the affinity to the gods to be attained \n\nby the sacrifice of a son. \n\nIt is strange that these same people who permitted the killing of their \nown children by cutting their throats or burying them alive abstained from \nthe eating of certain vegetable stuff and beef. Stranger still is that they \nconsidered such abstinence as part of their religion, attributing it to Allah's \ncommand.” But Allah rejected their false claim: \n\n#And they say, 'These cattle and crops are sacred; none shall eat of \nthem except those whom we wish’, - so they assert - ‘and cattle whose \n\nbacks are prohibited (to burden), as well as cattle on which (at \n\nslaughter) the name of Allah is not mentioned, fabricated lies against \nHim. He will assuredly recompense them for what they have forged. ~ \n\n(Al-An’am: 138) \n\nMoreover, the Qur'an exposed the error of those who made halal what is \nprohibited and made haram what is permitted: \n\n# Lost are those who kill their children in folly, without knowledge and \nprohibited what Allah has provided them, forging (lies) against Allah. \nThey have indeed gone astray and are without guidance. & \n\n(Al-An’am: 140) \n\nWhen Islam came, the errors, confusions, and deviations with respect to \nthe question of halal and haram were very rampant. One of Islam's initial \naccomplishments was, therefore, to establish certain legal principles and \nmeasures for rectifying this vital issue; these principles were then made the \ndetermining criteria on which the questions of what is halal and what is \nharam were to be based. Thus this vital aspect was determined according to \nthe correct perspective, and rules related to matters of halal and haram were \n\n1. It should be noted that while worshiping and ascribing powers to numerous male and female dei- \nlies, the pagan Arabs of the pre-Islamic era had the concept of a supreme Deity, Allah, ascribing \nto Him many false attributes and laws. (Translator)\n\n\n\nestablished on the principle of justice. The Muslim Ummah (nation) thus \n\nbecame a nalion, occupying a position midway between the extremist \n\ndeviations to the right and to the left, which Allah (Glory be to Him) \n\ndescribes as a \"middle Ummah\" (Al-Bagarah: [43) and \"the best Ummah that \n\nhas ever been brought forth for mankind.\" (Al “Imran: 110) \n\n\n\n1. The EssenceAs/: \n\nPermissibility of Things \n\nThe first as/, or principle, established by Islam is that the things which \nAllah has created and the benefits derived from them are essentially for \nman's use, and hence are permissible. Nothing is haram except what is \nprohibited by a sound and explicit nass@ from the Law-Giver, Allah (Glory \nbe to Him). If the nass is not sound, as for example in the case of a weak \n\nhadith, or if it is not explicit in stating the prohibition, the original principle \n\nof permissibility applies. \n\nMuslim scholars have derived this principle of the natural utility and \npermissibility of things from the clear verses of the Qur'an. For example, \nAllah says, \n\nIt is He who created all that is in the earth for you... € y \n(Al-Bagarah: 29) \n\n@ He has subjected to you, from Himself, all that is in the heavens and \n\nall that is on the earth... ® \n\n(Al-Jathiyah: 13) \n\nDo you not see that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the \n\nheavens and what is on earth, and has showered upon you His favors, \n\nboth apparent and unseen’... » \n\n(Luqman: 20) \n\nIt cannot be that Allah (Glorified be He) created all these things, gave \n\nman control over them, counted them as His favors upon him, and then after \n\nthat to inform him that their use is prohibited; how could this be when He \n\n1. Asi, plural usul, denotes origin, source, foundation, basis, fundamental, or principle. (Translator) \n\n2. Nass denotes either a verse of the Qur'an or a clear, authentic, and explicit sunnah (practice or \n\nsaying) of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). These two are the main sources of Islamic Shari‘ah. \n(Translator) \n\n{ 6) — \n\n\n\ncreated all this for man's use and benefit? He has, indeed, prohibited only a \n\nfew things for specific reasons, the wisdom of which will be discussed later. \n\nIn Islam, the sphere of things prohibited is very small, while that of \n\nthings permissible is extremely vast. There is only a small number of sound \n\nand explicit texts concerning prohibitions, while whatever 1s not mentioned \n\nin a nass as being lawful or prohibited falls under the general principle of \n\nthe permissibility of things and within the scope of Allah's favor. In this \n\nregard, the Prophet (pbuh) said, \n\n\"What Allah has made lawful in His Book is halal and what He has \n\nprohibited is haram, and that concerning which He is silent is allowed \n\nus His favor. So accept from Allah His favor, for Allah is not forgetful of \n\nanything.” \n\nHe then recited, \n\n@... And thy Lord is not forgetful. » \n\n(Maryam: 64)\" \n\nSalman al-Farsi reported that when the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was \n\nasked about animal fat, cheese, and fur, he replied, \n\n\"The lawful is that which Allah has made lawful in His Book and the \n\nprohibited is that which He has prohibited in His Book, and that \n\nconcerning which He is silent He has permitted as a favor to you. (2) \n\nThus, rather than giving specific answers to what the speaker has asked, \n\nthe Prophet (pbuh) referred to the general criterion for determining the halal \n\nand the haram. Accordingly, it is sufficient for us to know what Allah has \n\nmade haram, since what is not included in it is deemed pure and \n\npermissible. The Prophet (pbuh) also said, \n\n\"Allah has prescribed certain obligations for you, so do not neglect \n\nthem; He has defined certain limits, so do not transgress them; He has \n\nprohibited certain things, so do not do them; and He has kept silent \n\nconcerning other things out of mercy for you and not because of \n\nforgetfulness, so do not ask (questions) concerning them. (3) \n\n1. This hadith was narrated by Al-Hakim, who classified it as sahih, and quoted by Al-Bazzar. \n\n2. Narrated by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah. \n\n3. Narrated by Ad-Daruqutni and classified as hasan by An-Nawawi. \n\nNY \n\n\n\n1 would like to emphasize here that the principle of natural permissibility \n\nis not limited to things and objects but also includes all human actions and \n\nbehavior not related to acts of worship, which may be termed living habits \n\nor day-to-day affairs. Here again, the principle is that these are allowed \n\nwithout restriction, with the exception of a small number of things which are \n\ndefinitely prohibited by the Law-Giver, Allah (Glory be to Him), Who says, \n\n@... He (Allah) has explained to you what He has made haram for \n\nVOU... & \n\n(Al-An’am: 119) \n\nincluding both objects and actions. \n\nThe case is different, however, in relation to acts of worship. These are \n\npurely religious acts which can be taken only from what Allah Himself \n\nreveals. Concerning this we have a sound hadith: \n\n“Any innovation in our matter (religion) which is not a part of it must be \n\nrejected.) \n\nAnyone who invents or originates a form of worship on his own has \n\ngone astray and must be repudiated, for only the Law-Giver Himself has the \n\nright to originate acts of worship through which human beings may seek \n\nnearness to Him. Living habits and day-to-day matters, however, did not \n\noriginate with the Law-Giver; they were originated and acted upon by \n\nhuman beings themselves. Thus the Law-Giver intervenes only to rectify \n\nsome practices which are harmful or which may lead to strife. \n\nThe great Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyah stated, \n\n\"Peoples’ sayings and actions are of two kinds: acts of worship by which \n\ntheir religion is established, and customary practices which are required for \n\nday-to-day living. From the principles of the Shari‘ah, we know that acts of \n\nworship are those acts which have been prescribed by Allah or approved by \n\nHim; nothing is to be affirmed here except through the Shariah. However, \n\nas far as the worldly activities of people are concerned, they are necessary \n\nfor everyday life. Here the principle is freedom of action; nothing may be \n\nrestricted in this regard except what Allah (Glory be to Him) has restricted. \n\n1. This hadith is classified as muttafaq “alayh. \n\n\n\nThis is the case because commanding and prohibiting are both in Allah's \n\nHands. As far as worship is concerned, there has to be a command from \n\nHim concerning it. Thus, when it requires a command (from Allah) to \n\nestablish something, how can we say that something is restricted without \n\nHis command? \n\nThis is why Ahmad (ibn Hanbal) and other jurists specialized in Hadith \n\nLiterature, say: In relation to acts of worship, the principle is limitation \n\n(tawgif); that is to say, nothing can be legislated in this regard except what \n\nAllah Himself has legislated. To do otherwise is to incur the risk of being \n\nincluded in the meaning of the verse: \n\n@ Do they have partners (with Allah) who have prescribed for them in \n\nreligion that concerning which Allah has given no permission?... ® \n\n(Ash-Shura: 21) \n\nBut as far as living habits are concerned, the principle is freedom \n\nbecause nothing can be restricted in this regard except what Allah Himself \n\nhas prohibited. Here, to do otherwise, is to be included in the meaning of \n\nHis saying: \n\n& Say: Do you see what Allah has sent down to you for sustenance? Yet \n\nyou have made some part of it haram and some part halal. » \n\n(Yunus: 59) \n\nThis is a great and beneficent principle, on the basis of which we can say \n\nthat buying, selling, leasing, giving gifts, and such other matters are as \n\nnecessary activities for people as eating, drinking, and the wearing of \n\nclothes. If the Shari‘ah says something concerning these mundane matters, \n\nit is in order to teach good behavior. Accordingly, it has prohibited whatever \n\nleads to strife, has made obligatory that which is essential, has disapproved \n\nthat which is frivolous, and has approved that which is beneficial. All this \n\nhas been done with due consideration for the kinds of activities involved, \n\ntheir magnitudes, and properties. \n\nSince this is the stand of the Shari‘ah, people are free to buy, sell, and \n\nlease as they wish, just as they are free to eat and to drink what they like as \n\nlong as it is not haram. Although some of these things may be disapproved, \n\nthey are free in this regard, since the Shariah does not go to the extent of \n\n\n\nprohibiting them, and thus the original principle (of permissibility) \n\nremains,\"“) \n\nThis principle is also supported by what is reported in a sound tradition \n\nby the Prophet's Companion, Jabir ibn “Abdullah. He said, \"We used to \n\npractice ‘az/ (coitus interruptus, or withdrawal before ejaculation during \n\nintercourse) during the period when the Qur'an was being revealed. If the \n\npractice were to have been prohibited, the Qur'an would have prohibited it.\" \n\nHe therefore concluded that if the divine revelation was silent about \n\nsomething, it was permissible and people were free to practice it. Assuredly, \n\nthe Prophet's Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) had a perfect \n\nunderstanding of the Shari‘ah. Accordingly, this great principle - that no \n\nworship can be ordained except by the command of Allah, and no practice \n\ncan be prohibited except by His prohibition - is firmly established. \n\n1. Al-Qawa‘id an-Nuraniyyah al-Fighiyyah by Ibn Taymiyah, pp. 112-113. According to this \n\nprinciple, Ibn Taymiyah, his disciple Ibn al-Qayyim, and the Hanbali jurists in general hold that \n\ncontracts and the conditions laid down in them are essentially permissible, as any contract that \n\ndoes not involve any matter that is established as haram by a nass is valid. \n\n\n\n2. To Make Lawful and to Prohibit \n\nIs the Right of Allah Alone \n\nThe second principle is that Islam has restricted the authority to legislate \n\nthe haram and the halal, taking it out of the hands of human beings, \n\nregardless of their religious or worldly position, and reserving it for the \n\nLord of human beings alone. Neither rabbis nor priests, kings or sultans, \n\nhave the right to prohibit something permanently to Allah's servants; if \n\nsomeone does this, he has certainly exceeded his limits, usurping the \n\nsovereignty which, with respect to legislating for the people, belongs to \n\nAllah (Glory be to Him) alone. Others who acquiesce to this transgression \n\nof such usurpers and act upon what they have legislated thereby elevate \n\nthem to the rank of partners or associates with Allah: \n\n¢ Do they have associates (with Allah) who have prescribed for them in \n\nreligion that concerning which Allah has given no permission?... ® \n\n(Ash-Shura: 21) \n\nThe Qur'an blamed the People of the Book, that is, Christians and Jews, \n\nfor putting the power to make lawful and to prohibit things and actions into \n\nthe hands of their rabbis and priests. \n\n4 They have taken their rabbis and priests as lords besides Allah, and \n\nthe Messiah, son of Mary, although they were commanded to worship no \n\none except the One Allah. There is no deity but He, Glory be to Him \n\nabove what they associate with Him! » \n\n(At-Tawbah: 31) \n\n~Adi ibn Hatim, who had been a Christian before accepting Islam, once \n\ncame to the Prophet (pbuh). When he heard him reciting the above verse he \n\nsaid, \"O Messenger of Allah, but they did not worship them.\" The Prophet \n\n(pbuh) replied, \n\n\n\n\"Yes, but they prohibited to the people what was halal and permitted \nthem what was haram, and the people obeyed them. This is how they \n\nworshiped them.) \n\nChristians still claim that Prophet “Isa (peace be upon him), before \n\nascending to heaven vested in His apostles the authority to declare things \npermissible or prohibited as they saw fit, as reported in Matthew 18:18, \n\n\"I tell you the truth: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, \nand whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\" \n\nThe Qur'an also blamed the polytheists for ordaining and prohibiting \nthings without any authority from Allah: \n\n# Do you see what Allah has sent down to you for sustenance and yet \nyou have made some part of it haram and some part halal?... » \n\n(Yunus: 59) \n\n@ And do not say, concerning the falsehood which your tongues utter, \nThis is halal and that is haram,' in order to fabricate a lie against \nAllah; assuredly those who fabricate a lie against Allah will not \nprosper. ® \n\n(An-Nahl: 116) \n\nFrom these explicit verses of the Qur'an and from clear hadiths of the \nProphet (pbuh) the jurists of Islam grasped with certainty that it is Allah \n(Glory be to Him) alone Who has the right to make lawful or to prohibit a \nmatter, either through His Book or through the tongue of His Messenger \n(pbuh). The jurists’ task does not go beyond explaining what Allah has \ndecreed to be halal or haram @.. He has explained to you in detail what He has \nmade haram for you...» (Al-An’am: 119) It is definitely not their task to \ndecide what is to be allowed and what is to be prohibited to human beings. \nThus the great jurists, in spite of their scholarship and ability of ijtihad, \nrefrained from pronouncing judgements concerning matters of halal and \nharam, passing the problem from one to the other out of fear of committing \nthe error of declaring halal what is actually haram and vice-versa. \n\nIn his book Al-'Umm, Imam Shafi*i narrated that Abu Yusuf, a \ncompanion of Abu Hanifah and a chief judge (gadi), said, \n\n1. Narrated by At-Tirmidhi and others. \n\n\n\n\"l witnessed that our knowledgeable teachers avoided saying, \"This 1s \n\nhalal and that is haram,' apart from what they found clearly stated without \n\nrequiring an interpretation in the Book of Allah. We have been told by Ibn \n\nas-Sayb that Ar-Rabi ibn Khaytham, one of the greatest of the second \n\ngeneration of Muslims, said, ‘Beware that none of you says, ‘Allah has \n\nmade this lawful or approves of it’. Allah may then say that He did not make \n\nit lawful nor approve it; or that you say, ‘Allah has prohibited this’. Allah \n\nmay then, say 'You lic! I have not prohibited nor disapproved of it’. Some \n\ncompanions of Ibrahim an-Nakh‘i, a great jurist of Kufah among the second \n\ngeneration of Muslims, have told us of his mentioning his colleagues as \n\nsaying, when they gave a judgement concerning something, ‘It is \n\ndisapproved’ or \"There is no harm in it,’ rather than, ‘It is haram ' or ‘Tt is \n\nhalal’, as haram and halal are terms of much greater import.\" \n\nThis is what Abu Yusuf reported concerning our righteous forebears and \n\nwhat Ash-Shafi°i quoted from him, and completely agreed with. Similarly, \n\nIbn Muflih reported the great scholar Ibn Taymiyah as saying that the jurists \n\nof the early days of Islam did not pronounce anything haram unless it was \n\ndefinitely known to be so.”) In the same spirit, the great Imam Ahmad ibn \n\nHanbal, when asked about some matter, would say, \"I disapprove of it” or \n\n\"It does not appeal to me,\" or \"I do not like it\" or \"I do not prefer it.” Similar \n\nreports are narrated concerning Malik, Abu Hanifah, and all the other \n\nImams (may Allah be pleased with them). \n\n1. Al-’'Umm, vol. 7, P. 3147. \n\n2. This is further supported by the fact that the Companions did not give up the drinking of wine \n\nafter the revelation of the Quranic verse: @ They ask thee conceming wine and gambling. Say: \n\nIn them is great sin and some benefit..., (Al-Baqarah: 219) since this verse did not definitely \n\nprohibit drinking prior to the revelation of the verses in Surat al-Ma'idah (90-91). \n\n3. This is a lesson to the followers of such Imams who freely use the word \"haram\" without having \n\na proof, or even a semblance of a proof. \n\n\n\n3. Prohibiting the Halal \n\nand Permitting the Haram \n\nIs Similar to Committing Shirk \n\nWhile Islam reprimands all those who, on their own authority, declare \nwhat is lawful and what is prohibited, it is more strict with respect to those \nwho voice prohibitions; for the tendency to make up prohibitions results in \nhardship for human beings, unjustifiably narrowing what Allah has made \nspacious for His creatures. Moreover, this tendency is prevalent among \nsome of those who go to extremes in matters of religion and so must be \nchecked. The Prophet (pbuh) fought against this false piety and ecstasy by \nall means, warning those who indulged in it with the words, \"The zealots \nwill perish,” repeated three times.“ \n\nThe Prophet (pbuh) characterized his Message by saying, \n\n\"I have been sent with what is straight and easy.\" \n\nThe straightness of his Message consists in belief in the Oneness of \nAllah and its ease in practice and legislation, in contrast to shirk \n(polytheism) and to the prohibiting of good things of this life. The Prophet \n(pbuh) has mentioned all this in a Hadith Qudsi, reporting the saying of \nAllah (Glorified be He): \n\n\"l created My servants upright (hunafa'). Then the evil ones came to \n\nthem and led them astray from their religion, and forbade what I had \nmade lawful for them and commanded them to associate with Me that for \n\nwhich I had not sent down any authority.\" \n\nProhibiting something which is halal is similar to committing shirk, and \nthis is why the Qur'an censured the idolaters of Arabia for their polytheism, \n\n1. Narrated by Muslim, Ahmad, and Abu Dawud. \n\n2. Narrated by Ahmad. \n\n3. Narrated by Muslim. \n\n\n\ntheir idols, and for prohibiting to themselves, without any authority from \n\nAllah, the eating and the use of certain kinds of crop and cattle. Among \n\nthese prohibited animals were those which were called bahirah, sa'ibah, \n\nwasilah, and ham during the pre-Islamic period of Jahiliyyah. Bahirah (the \n\nslit-eared) denoted a female camel which had given birth to five calves, the \n\nlast of which was a male. The ear of such a camel was slit and she was \n\nloosed to roam freely; she was not to be ridden, milked, or slaughtered, and \n\nwas free to eat and drink from any place she liked without hindrance. \n\nSa'ibah referred to a male or female camel which was released to roam \n\nfreely because of a vow, usually made following a safe return from a \n\njourney, the cure of an illness, or for some other reason. As for wasilah, if \n\nthe firstborn of a female goat were a he-goat, the polytheists would sacrifice \n\nhim to their gods, while if it were a she-goat they would keep her for \n\nthemselves. In case of twin offspring, one female and the other male, they \n\nwould say, \"He is her brother,\" and instead of sacrificing the male they \n\nwould release him to roam free; he was known as wasilah. And if a male \n\ncamel's second generation offspring was capable of carrying a rider, they \n\nwould let the older camel go free, saying, \"He saved his back,” and calling \n\nhim ham. \n\nWhile there are other interpretations to these four terms, they are all of a \n\nsimilar nature. The Qur'an rejected these prohibitions and left no excuse for \n\nthose who practiced them to follow the errors of their forefathers: \n\n@ Allah did not appoint \"anything\" as bahirah or sa'ibah or wasilah or \n\nham; but those who disbelieve forge a lie against Allah, and most of \n\nthem do not consider. When it is said to them, 'Come to what Allah has \n\nrevealed and to the Messenger,’ they say, 'What we found our fathers \n\ndoing is enough for us'. What! And even though their fathers did not \n\nknow anything and were not rightly guided? » \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 103-104) \n\nIn Surat al-An‘am, there is a detailed discussion of what such people \n\nclaimed to be haram of camels, oxen, sheep, and goats. In this context, the \n\nQur'an uses an ironic style of rhetorical questioning to convince them of \n\ntheir error: \n\n\n\n¢ Eight pairs (of cattle), two of mutton and two of goats. Say: Has He \n\nforbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of \n\nthe two females hold? Inform Me with knowledge if you are truthful. And \n\ntwo (pairs) of camels and two of oxen. Say: Has He forbidden the two \n\nmales or the two females?... » \n\n(Al-An’am: 143-144) \n\nIn another discussion contained in Surat al-A*raf, Allah (Glory be to \n\nHim) rejects the claims of all prohibitors, laying down the final criteria \n\ngoverning prohibitions: \n\n@ Say: Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has brought \n\nforth for His servants, and the good things of His providing?... Say: \n\nWhat my Lord has indeed prohibited are shameful deeds, whether open \n\nor secret, and sin and rebellion without just cause, and that you \n\nassociate with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and \n\nthat you say concerning Allah that about which you do not know. p \n\n(AI-A’ raf: 32-33) \n\nA significant aspect of these discussions is that they were revealed in \n\nMakkah. The Makkan revelations invariably dealt with matters of faith, the \n\nOneness of Allah (Glorified be He), and the Hereafter. We may, therefore, \n\ndeduce that, in the sight of Allah, this matter of declaring things to be \n\nprohibited without any authority from Him was not a minor matter but one \n\nwhich pertained to the fundamentals and general principles of the faith. \n\nIn Madinah certain Muslims showed a tendency toward asceticism, \n\ndenying themselves some permissible pleasures. Then, in order to keep \n\nthem within the limits set by Himself and bring them back to the straight \n\npath of Islam, Allah revealed the following strongly-worded verses: \n\n¢ You who believe! Do not make haram the good things which Allah has \n\nmade halal for you, and do not transgress; indeed, Allah does not like \n\nthe transgressors. And eat of what Allah has provided for you, lawful \n\nand good, and fear Allah, in Whom you are believers. » \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 87-88) \n\n\n\n4. The Prohibition of Things Is Due \n\nto Their Impurity and Harmfulness \n\nIt is the right of Allah, the One Who created human beings and bestowed \n\ninnumerable gifts on them, to legitimize or prohibit as He deems proper, and \n\nto place obligations and responsibilities upon them as He sees fit. As His \n\ncreatures, they have neither the right to question nor to disobey Him. But \n\nAllah (Glory be to Him) is not arbitrary in what He commands. Because He \n\nis Merciful to His servants, He makes things halal and haram for a reason, \n\nthe well-being of nations in view. Accordingly, He has neither permitted \n\nanything except what is pure nor has He prohibited anything except what is \n\nimpure. \n\nIt is true that Allah (Glorified be He) had prohibited certain good things \n\nto the Jews, but this was only as a punishment for their rebelliousness and \n\ntransgression of the limits set by Allah. Thus He says, \n\n@ And to the Jews We forbade every animal with claws, and of oxen and \n\nsheep We have forbidden them their fat, except what is carried on their \n\nbacks or entrails, or what is connected to the bone; thus did We \n\nrecompense them for their rebelliousness, and indeed, We speak the \n\ntruth. ® \n\n(Al-An‘am: 146) \n\nElsewhere in the Qur'an, Allah describes other manifestations of this \n\nrebellious attitude: \n\n@ Because of the injustice of the Jews, We prohibited to them some of the \n\ngood things which had been permitted to them, and because of their \n\nhindering many from the path of Allah, and their taking usury although \n\nthey had been forbidden to do it, and their wrongfully devouring \n\npeoples’ wealth... ® \n\n(An-Nisa’: 160-161) \n\n\n\nWhen Allah sent His last Messenger (pbuh) with the eternal complete \n\nreligion to humanity after it had developed to a state of maturity, He \n\ndemonstrated His mercy by removing these prohibitions, which had been a \n\ntemporary penalty for a rebellious, stiff-necked people.“ And the coming of \nthe Prophet (pbuh) who would relieve them of this burden was foretold onto \n\nthe Jews and Christians. The Qur'an states, \n\n@... (They) find (him) described in their own scriptures, in the Tawrah \n\nand the Injil.?) He commands them what is right and forbids them what \n\nis evil; He makes lawful to them what is good and makes unlawful what \n\nis foul; He releases them from their burdens and from the yokes which \n\nwere upon them... » \n\n(Al-A’raf: 157) \n\nIn Islam, ways other than prohibiting the good things were prescribed by \n\nAllah (Glorified be He) for the eradication of sins: sincere repentance, \n\nwhich cleanses sins as water cleanses dirt; good deeds, which put away evil \n\nones; spending in charity, which extinguishes the error as water \n\nextinguishes the fire; and trials and sufferings, which disperse sins as the \n\nwinter wind disperses dry leaves. Accordingly, we know that in Islam things \n\nare prohibited only because they are impure or harmful. If something is \n\nentirely harmful it is haram, and if it is entirely beneficial it is halal; if the \n\nharm of it outweighs its benefit it is haram, while if its benefit outweighs its \n\nharm it is halal. This principle is explained in the Qur'an in relation to wine \n\nand gambling: \n\n& They ask thee concerning wine and gambling. Say (O Prophet): In \n\nthem is great sin and some benefit for human beings, but the sin is \n\ngreater than the benefit... \n\n(Al-Baqarah: 219) \n\nBy the same logic, if it is asked, what is halal in Islam, the answer is, the \n\ngood things. Good things are those which moderate people acknowledge to \n\nbe wholesome and which are approved by human beings in general without \n\nrelation to the habits of a particular group. Allah (Glorified be He) says, \n\n1. See, for example. Exodus 32: 9. \n\n2. Tawrah refers to the original scripture that Allah revealed to Prophet Musa, and Injil refers to the \n\nscripture He revealed to Prophet “Isa. These are not to be confused either with the existing Torah \n\nor Old Testament, or the four Gospels of the New Testament. (Translator). \n\nC18} XY \n\n\n\n& They ask thee what is lawful to them (as food). Say: Whatever is good \n\nis lawful to you... ® th \n(Al-Ma'idah: 4) \n\n¢ Today whatever is good is made lawful to you... & \n(Al-Ma'idah: 5) \n\nA Muslim is not required to know exactly what is unclean or harmful in \n\nwhat Allah has prohibited; it may be hidden from him but be apparent to \n\nsomeone else, or its harm may not have been discovered during his lifetime \n\nbut may be understood at a later period. What is required of a Muslim is \n\nsimply to say, \"We have heard and we shall obey.\" Do we not observe that \n\nAllah prohibited the eating of pork without the Muslims being aware of the \n\nreason for its prohibition apart from the fact that the pig is a filthy animal? \n\nCenturies passed, and then scientific research discovered the presence of \n\nparasites and deadly bacteria in its flesh. Yet even if scientific research had \n\ndiscovered nothing in pork, or if it had discovered much more than this, the \n\nMuslim would still continue to believe it to be unclean. \n\nAnother example of this is in the Prophet's saying, \n\n\"Ayoid three abominable acts (that is, the one who does them is cursed \n\nby Allah and by the people): defecating in streams, (defecating) on \n\nroadways, and (defecating) in shaded places. ml) \n\nThe people of earlier times merely knew that these were filthy acts, \n\nabhorrent to civilized taste and public manners. With the advancement of \n\nscience, we now know that these \"three abominable acts\" are hazards to \n\npublic health, as they are the root-cause of the spread of such dangerous \n\ndiseases as hookworm (ancylostomiasis) and bilharzia (schistosomiasis). \n\nThus, as the light of knowledge penetrates more deeply and new \n\ndiscoveries are made, the beneficial aspects of the Islamic dispensation \n\nrelating to the lawful and the prohibited - in fact, the benefits of all its legal \n\ninjunctions - become apparent to us. How could it be otherwise when they \n\ncome from the Wise, All-Knowing, and Merciful God? \n\n€... and Allah knows the corrupter from the reformer. And if Allah had \n\nwilled, He could have put you into difficulties; indeed, Allah is Ever \n\nMighty, Ever Wise. & \n(Al-Bagarah: 220) \n\n1. Narrated by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and Al-Hakim, and classified as sahih by Al-Bayhaqi. \n\n\n\n5. What Is Halal Is Sufficient, \n\nWhile What Is Haram Is Superfluous \n\nOne of the beauties of Islam is that it has prohibited only such things \nwhich are unnecessary and dispensable, while providing alternatives which \nare better and which give greater ease and comfort to human beings. This \n\npoint has been explained by Ibn al-Qayyim: \n\n“Allah has prohibited seeking omens by drawing lots but has provided \nthe alternative of istikharah which is a supplication for seeking Allah's \nguidance. \n\nHe has prohibited usury but has encouraged profitable trade. He has \nprohibited gambling but has permitted betting in the form of competition \nwhich is useful for religious striving, such as horse or camel racing and \ncompeting in marksmanship. \n\nHe has prohibited (to men) the wearing of silk but has given them the \nchoice of other materials such as wool, linen, and cotton. \n\nHe has prohibited adultery, fornication, and homosexuality but has \nencouraged lawful marriage. \n\nHe has prohibited intoxicating drinks in order that they may enjoy other \ndelicious drinks which are wholesome for the body and mind. \n\nAnd, He has prohibited unclean food but provided alternative \nwholesome food.\"()) \n\nThus, wherever we survey the Islamic injunctions in their totality, we \nfind that if Allah limits the choice of His servants in relation to some things, \nHe provides them with a still wider range of more wholesome alternatives in \nrelation to other things of a similar kind. For, Allah has no desire, indeed, to \nmake people's lives difficult, narrow, and circumscribed; on the contrary, \n\n1. Rawdat al-Muhibbin, p. 10, and A‘lam al-Muwagqgqi in, vol. 2, p. 111. \n\n\n\nHe desires ease, goodness, guidance, and thercy for them, according to His \n\nsaying, \n\n@ Allah desires to make clear to you and to guide you to the ways of the \n\n(righteous) people before you and to turn to you in mercy; and Allah is \n\nKnowing, Wise. And Allah desires to relent to you, and those who follow \n\ntheir lusts desire that you should deviate with a great deviation. And \n\nAllah desires to lighten your burden, for man was created weak. » \n\n(An-Nisa’: 26-28) \n\n\n\n6. Whatever Is Conducive \n\nto the Haram Is Itself Haram \n\nAnother Islamic principle is that if something is prohibited, anything \nwhich leads to it is likewise prohibited. By this means, Islam intends to \nblock all avenues leading to what is haram. For example, as Islam has \nprohibited sex outside marriage, it has also prohibited anything which leads \nto it or makes it attractive, such as seductive clothing, private meetings and \ncasual mixing between men and women, the depiction of nudity, \npornographic literature, obscene songs, and so on. \n\nAccordingly, Muslim jurists have established the criterion that whatever \nis conducive to or leads toward haram is itself haram. A similar principle is \nthat the sin of the haram is not limited to the person engaged in it but \nextends to others who have supported him, materially or morally; each is \nheld accountable according to his share. For example, in the case of \n\nintoxicating drinks, the Prophet (pbuh) cursed not only the one who drinks \nthem but also the one who produces them, the one who serves them, the one \n\nto whom they are served, the one to whom the price is paid, etc. This point \nwill be discussed later. Again, in the matter of usury, the Prophet (pbuh) \ncursed the one who pays it, the one to whom it is paid, the one who writes \nthe contract, and the one who acts as a witness thereto. Accordingly, we \nderive the rule that anything which assists in the doing of what is haram is \nitself haram, and anyone who helps another person to do it shares the sin.\n\n\n\n7. Falsely Representing the Haram \n\nas Halal Is Prohibited \n\nJust as Islam has prohibited whatever leads toward the haram, it has also \n\nprohibited resorting to technical legalities in order to do what is haram by \n\ndevious means arid excuses inspired by Satan. It has reprimanded the Jews \n\nfor resorting to such practices. The Prophet (pbuh) said, \n\n\"Do not do what the Jews did by (technically) legalizing Allah's \n\nprohibitions by flimsy excuses. mi) \n\nThis is a reference to the fact that Allah had prohibited the Jews to hunt \n\non the Sabbath (Saturday). To evade this prohibition, they would dig ditches \n\non Friday so that the fish would fall into them on Saturday, to be caught on \n\nSunday. Those who resort to rationalizations and excuses to justify their \n\nactions consider such practices to be permissible, but the jurists of Islam \n\nconsider them haram, since Allah's purpose was to prevent them from \n\nhunting on the Sabbath, whether by direct or indirect means. \n\nCalling a haram thing by a name other than its own or changing its form \n\nwhile retaining its essence is devious tactic, since obviously a change of \n\nname or of form is of no consequence as long as the thing and its essence \n\nremain unchangeable. Thus, when some people invent new terms in order to \n\ndeal in usury or to consume alcohol, the sin of dealing in usury and drinking \n\nremains. As we read in the collections of hadiths, \n\n\"A group of my nation will make intoxicants halal by giving them other \n4 \n\nnames.\" \n\n\"A time will come when people will devour riba, calling it \"trade\". m3) \n\n1. This Aadith is mentioned in Ighathat al-Lahfan by Ibn al-Qayyim, vol. 1, p. 3485. The author said \n\nit was reported by ‘Abdullah ibn Battah on good authority and that At-Tirmidhi classified a sim- \n\nilar hadith as sahih. \n\n2. Narrated by Ahmad. \n\n3. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. \n\n\n\nAnd among the strange phenomena of our time is that people term \nobscene dance \"art,\" liquor \"spirits,\" and riba \"interest\". \n\n\n\n8. Good Intentions Do not Make \n\nthe Haram Acceptable \n\nIn all its legislations and moral injunctions, Islam lays great stress on \n\nnobility of feelings, loftiness of aims, and purity of intentions. The Prophet \n\n(pbuh) said, \n\n“Actions will be judged by intentions, and everyone will be recompensed \n\naccording to his intention.\" \n\nIndeed, in Islam the routine matters of life and its mundane affairs are \n\ntransformed into acts of worship and devotion to Allah by good intentions. \n\nAccordingly, if one eats food with the intention of sustaining life and \n\nstrengthening his body in order that he may be able to carry out his \n\nobligations to his Creator and to other human beings, his eating and \n\ndrinking are considered worship and devotion to Allah (Glorified be He). \n\nAgain, if one enjoys sexual intimacy with his wife, desiring a child and \n\nseeking to keep himself and his wife chaste, it is considered an act of \n\nworship on his part, deserving of reward in the Hereafter. Concerning this \n\nthe Prophet (pbuh) said, \n\n\"When you satisfy your desire with your wife, it is counted for you as an \n\nact deserving of reward.” § 0 \n\nThose who were listening to him said, \"O Messenger of Allah, how can \n\nit be that one of us satisfies his desire and will then be rewarded for it?\" The \n\nProphet (pbuh) replied, \n\n\"Would it not be sinful if he had satisfied it in a prohibited manner? \n\nConsequently, if he satisfies it in a permissible manner, there is a reward \n\nfor him.\" \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari. \n\n2. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. \n\n\n\nHe also said, \n\n\"Anyone who seeks to get what is permissible from the world, keeping \n\nhimself away from sins, working for the sake of his family, and taking \n\ncare of his neighbor, will meet his Lord with a face shining like the full \n\nmoon, “) \n\nIn this manner, whenever any permissible action of the believer is \naccompanied by a good intention, his action becomes an act of worship. But \nthe case of the haram is entirely different; it remains haram no matter how \ngood the intention, how honorable the purpose, or how lofty the aim may \nbe. Islam can never consent to employing a haram means to achieve a \npraiseworthy end. Indeed, it insists that not only should the aim be \nhonorable but also that the means of attaining it should be pure. \"The end \njustifies the means\" is not the maxim of the Shari‘ah, nor is \"Secure your \n\nright even through wrong-doing\". This can never be, for the Shari‘ah \n\ndemands that the right should be secured through just means only. \n\nIf someone accumulates wealth through usury, forgery, gambling, \n\nprohibited games, or in any other haram manner in order to build a mosque, \n\nto establish a charitable foundation, or to do any other good work, the guilt \n\nof having done what is haram will not be lifted from him because of the \n\ngoodness of his objective; in Islam good aims and intentions cannot lessen \n\nthe sinfulness of what is haram. \n\nThis is what the Prophet (pbuh) taught us when he said, \n\n\"Verily, Allah is good and does not accept but what is good, and Allah \n\nhas commanded the Believers, with what He had already commanded \n\nHis Messengers, saying, ¢O you Messengers! Eat of whatever is good \n\nand do righteous deeds. Indeed, | am aware of what you do. 9?) He also \n\nsaid, 40 you who believe! Eat of the good things which We provide \n\nyou... pn \n\nThe Prophet (pbuh) then said, \n\n\"A man travels far, shaggy and dust-stained (for Hajj, ‘Umrah, or the \n\nlike), raising his hands to the sky (and saying), 'O Lord! O Lord! I \n\n1. The text of the hadith was narrated by At-Tabarani. \n\n2. Qur'an: 23: 51 \n\n3. Qur'an: 2: 172 \n\n\n\nbeseech You,’ while eating what is haram, drinking what ts haram, \n\nwearing what is haram, and nourishing himself through haram means. \n\nHow can his prayers be accepted!\" \n\nHe also said, \n\n\"If anyone amasses wealth through haram means and then gives charity \n\nof it, there is no reward for him and the burden of sin remains. m2) \n\nAgain he (pbuh) said, \n\n\"If a person earns property through haram means and then gives charity \n\nof it, it will not be accepted ( by Allah); if he spends from it there will be \n\nno blessing for it; and if he leaves it behind (at his death), it will be his \n\nprovision in the F ire. Indeed, Allah (Glorified be He) does not obliterate \n\none bad deed by another bad deed, but He cancels out a bad deed by a \n\ngood deed. Verily, an unclean thing does not wipe away another unclean \n\nthing.\" \n\n1. Narrated by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of Abu Hurayrah. \n\n2. Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim on the authority of Abu Hurayrah. \n\n3. Narrated by Ahmad and others on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ud. \n\nGD\n\n\n\n9. Doubtful Things Are to Be Avoided \n\nIt is Allah's mercy to human beings that He did not leave them in \nignorance of what is lawful and what is prohibited. Indeed, He has made \nexplicit what is halal and explained what is haram, as He says, \n\n# ... He has explained to vou what He has made haram for you... & \n\n(Al-An‘am: 119) \n\nAccordingly, one may do what is lawful and must avoid what is \nprohibited insofar as he has the choice. However, there is a gray area \nbetween the halal and the haram. This is the area of the doubtful. Some \npeople may not be able to decide whether a particular matter is permissible \nor forbidden; such confusion may be due either to doubtful evidence or \nbecause of doubt concerning the applicability of the text to the particular \ncircumstance or matter in question. \n\nIn relation to such matters, Islam considers it an act of piety for the \nMuslim to avoid doing what is doubtful in order to stay clear of doing \nsomething haram. This is similar to what was discussed earlier concerning \nthe blocking of the avenues which lead to what is haram. Such a cautious \napproach, moreover, trains the Muslim to be farsighted in planning and \nincreases his knowledge of affairs and people. The root of this principle is \nthe saying of the Prophet (pbuh): \n\n\"Verily, the halal is clear and the haram is clear. Between the two there \nare doubtful matters which many people do not know whether they are \nhalal or haram. He who avoids them in order to safeguard his religion \nand his honor is safe, while if someone engages in a part of them he may \nbe doing something haram, like anyone who grazes his animals near the \nhima (the grounds reserved for animals belonging to the king and which \nare out of bounds for others’ animals), it is thus quite likely that some of \nhis animals will stray into it. Truly, every king has a hima, and the hima \nof Allah is what He has prohibited.\" \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and others; the narration is taken from At-Tirmidhi. \n\n\n\n10. The Haram Is Prohibited \n\nto Everyone Alike \n\nIn the Shariah of Islam the haram has a universal applicability; here \n\nthere is no such thing as that which is prohibited to a non-Arab but \n\npermitted to an Arab, nor anything which is restricted to a Black but \n\nallowed to a White. For, in Islam there are no privileged classes or \n\nindividuals who, in the name of religion, can do whatever they please \n\naccording to their whims. Muslims do not have any privilege of making \n\nsomething haram for others while it is lawful for themselves; this cannot be, \n\nfor truly Allah is the Lord of all, and the Shariah of Islam is the guide for \n\nall. Whatever Allah has legislated through His Shariah holds for all human \n\nbeings and whatever he has prohibited holds for all human beings until the \n\nDay of Resurrection. \n\nFor example, stealing is equally haram for the Muslim and the \n\nnon-Muslim, and the punishment for it is the same, regardless of the family \n\nor the origin of the thief. The Prophet (pbuh) firmly enforced this rule, \n\nproclaiming, \n\n\"By Allah, if Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, were to steal, I \n\nwould cut her hand off.\" \n\nA case of theft was brought before the Prophet (pbuh) involving two \n\nsuspects, the one a Jew and the other a Muslim. Some relatives of the \n\nMuslim advanced circumstantial evidence to cast doubt on the Jew in order \n\nto save their man while he was, in fact, guilty. The Prophet (pbuh) was \n\nalmost persuaded to believe that the Muslim was innocent. Then a \n\nrevelation was sent down exposing the conspiracy, clearing the Jew of the \n\ncrime and directing the Prophet (pbuh) to establish justice without any bias: \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari. \n\n\n\n# Indeed, We have sent down to thee the Book with the truth, so that thou \nmightest judge between the people as shown by Allah; then do not be an \nadvocate for the treacherous, and seek forgiveness of Allah; indeed, \nAllah is Ever Forgiving, Ever Merciful. And do not plead on behalf of \nthose who deceive themselves; indeed, Allah does not like the one who is \ntreacherous and sinful. They may hide from men, but they cannot hide \nfrom Allah, for He is with them even when they hold, by night, discourse \nnot pleasing to Him, and Allah encompasses what they do. Ah! You are \nthe ones who pleaded for them in the life of this world, but who will \nplead for them with Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be \ntheir trustee? \n\n(An-Nisa': 105-109) \n\nIn the distorted scripture of the Jews, it is alleged that while usury or \ninterest is prohibited to the Jew when lending money to a brother Jew, there \nis no harm in charging it to a gentile, as stated in Deuteronomy 23: 19-20: \n\n\"You must not lend on interest (usury) to your brother, whether the loan be of \nmoney or food or anything else that may earn interest. You may demand interest on \na loan of a foreigner, but you must not demand interest from your brother...\" \n\nThe Qur'an also speaks about another similar tendency among the Jews, \nthat of cheating others who are not of their race or faith without feeling \nanything wrong in it. The Qur'an says, \n\n#.. And of them is he who, if you put in his custody one dinar, will not \npay it back to you, except as long as you are upright over him. That (is) \nbecause they say, 'There is no way over us as to the gentiles).' And they \nspeak lies against Allah. And they know (that). » \n\n(Al “Imran: 75) \n\nThey have unquestionably uttered falsehood in what they have ascribed \nto Allah, for the law of Allah does not discriminate between one people and \nanother, insofar as cheating is concerned, Allah has condemned it on the \ntongue of all His Messengers and Prophets. \n\nWith due apologies, we may say that this tendency to use a double \nstandard, one for one's \"brother\" and another for a \"foreigner\" or outsider, is \n\n1. \"Gentiles\" here refers to the Arabs, who before Islam possessed neither religion nor a divinely \nrevealed scripture. \n\nBO)\n\n\n\na characteristic of primitive cthics. It can never be ascribed to a divinely \n\nrevealed religion, for high morality - that is, true morality - is \n\ndistinguishable by its universality and comprehensiveness and by its lack of \n\na double standard. The distinction between us and primitive peoples is not in \n\nthe existence or absence of a moral code but in the enlargement of the area of \n\nits application. As an example, such people also consider honesty a \n\npraiseworthy quality, but they restrict its practice to the people of their own \n\ntribe. When dealing with people from outside their tribe or clan, they see \n\nnothing wrong with cheating them, or in fact recommending or even \n\nrequiring it. \n\nThe author of The Story of Civilization wrote, \n\n\"Almost all groups agree in holding other groups to be inferior to \n\nthemselves. The American Indians looked upon themselves as the chosen \n\npeople, specially created by the Great Spirit as an uplifting example for \n\nmankind. One Indian tribe called itself \"The Only Men;” another called \n\nitself \"Men of Men\". The Caribs said, ‘We alone are people.’ The Eskimos \n\nbelieved that the Europeans had come to Greenland to learn manners and \n\nvirtues. Consequently, it seldom occurred to primitive man to extend to \n\nother tribes the moral restraints which he acknowledged in dealing with his \n\nown; he frankly conceived it to be the function of morals to give strength \n\nand coherence to his group against other groups. Commandments and \n\ntaboos were applied only to the people of his tribe; with others, except when \n\nthey were his guests, he might go as far as he dared.\" \n\n1. Will Durant, The Story of Civilization, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1935, vol. 1, pp. 54-55. \n\n\n\n11. Necessity Dictates Exceptions \n\nWhile Islam has narrowed the range of what is prohibited, it is, at the \nsame time, very strict in seeing that its prohibitions are observed. \nAccordingly, it has blocked the ways, apparent or hidden, leading to what is \nprohibited. Thus, what is conducive to the haram is itself haram, what \n\nassists in committing the haram is haram, any rationalization for engaging \nin the haram is haram, and so on, to the last of the principles which we have \n\nelucidated. At the same time, Islam is not oblivious of the exigencies of life, \n\nto their magnitude, nor to human weakness and capacity to face them. It \npermits the Muslim, under the compulsion of necessity to eat prohibited \n\nfood in quantities sufficient to remove the necessity and save himself from \n\ndeath. \n\nIn this context, after listing the prohibited foods in the form of dead \n\nanimals, blood, and pork, Allah (Glorified be He) says, \n\n@... But if one is compelled by necessity, neither craving (it) nor \n\ntransgressing, there is no sin on him; indeed, Allah is Ever Forgiving, \n\nEver Merciful. \n\n(Al-Bagarah: 173) \n\nAnd this is repeated at four places in the Qur'an after each mention of \n\nthe prohibited foods. \n\nOn the basis of these and similar verses of the Qur'an, Muslim jurists \n\nformulated an important principle, namely, that \"necessity dictates \n\nexceptions\". However, it is to be noted that the individual experiencing the \nnecessity is permitted to eat of the haram food on the condition that he is \n\"neither craving it nor transgressing\". This is interpreted to mean that he \nshould not desire to relish it nor transgress by eating more that the bare \namount needed to satisfy his hunger. From this stipulation, jurists have \nderived another principle, that \"The quantity permitted is determined by \n(magnitude) of the necessity\". Here the underlying idea is that, even though \n\n\n\ncompelled by necessity, a person need not surrender to it or embrace it with \n\neagerness: rather he must live with what is essentially halal and seek a way \n\nof returning 10 it so as not to become accustomed to the haram or begin \n\nenjoying it under the pretext of necessity. \n\nIn permitting the use of the haram under necessity, Islam is truc to its \n\nspirit and general principles. This spirit, which we find permeating its law, \n\nis to make life easy and less oppressive for human beings, and to lift the \n\nburden and yoke imposed by earlier systems and religions. True is the \n\nsaying of Allah Almighty: \n\n@... Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire hardship for \n\nyou... & \n\n(Al-Bagarah: 185) \n\n@... It is not Allah's desire to place a burden upon you, but He desires to \n\npurify you and to perfect His favor on you in order that you may be \n\nthankful. & \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 6) \n\n@ Allah desires to lighten your burden, for man was created weak. \n\n(An-Nisa’: 28) \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO \n\nTHE LAWFUL AND THE PROHIBITED \n\ni fy a\nl\n \n\n= x < > Lau \n\nm4 oa fa) ee ee Z.

Food and Drink \n\nSince ancient times, peoples have differed in their eating and drinking \n\nhabits and in relation to what is to be allowed and avoided, especially with \n\nregard to food of animal origin. \n\nConcerning food and drink of vegetable origin, the peoples of the earth \n\nhave been close to a consensus. Islam does not prohibit vegetarian foods, \n\nwith the exception of what turns into an intoxicant, whether it be grapes, \n\ndates, barley, or any other substance that becomes so. Similarly, Islam \n\nprohibits anything which intoxicates, affects the functioning of the brain, or \n\nharms the body, as we shall see later. However, with regard to foods derived \n\nfrom animal sources, peoples and nations have held widely varying \n\nattitudes. \n\nThe Attitude of the Brahmins Toward Slaughtering \n\nAnimals and Eating Meat \n\nThe Brahmins and a group of philosophers, subsisting on vegetarian \n\nfood, only prohibit to themselves the killing and eating of animals. They \n\nclaim that the slaughtering of animals is a cruelty inflicted by men on these \n\ncreatures, who are living beings like themselves and that they must not \n\ndeprive the animals of their right to live. \n\nHowever, when we ponder the creation, we realize that these animals \n\nhave not been created for their own sake, because they have not been \n\nendowed with intellect or freedom of choice; we also see that their natural \n\nposition is such that they have been subjected to the service of man. It is \n\ntherefore not to be doubted that man should benefit from their flesh after \n\nslaughter just as he benefits from their service while they are alive. \n\nAgain, we realize that it is the law of Allah in His creation that the lower \n\norder of species be sacrificed for the benefit of the higher. Thus green plants \n\nare cut and fed to an animal, the animal is slaughtered to be food for man, \n\n\n\nand a man must also fight and risk his life for the sake of the group. \nMoreover, even if a man refrains from slaughtering an animal, it will not \nthereby be saved from death and destruction; it will either become prey to \nsome other animal or will die in some other way, possibly in a much more \npainful manner than by a quick stroke of a sharp knife. \n\nAnimals Prohibited to the Jews and Christians \n\nIn the divinely revealed religions, Allah prohibited to the Jews the eating \nof many land and marine animals; for description of these one may refer to \nthe Old Testament book of Leviticus, chapter eleven. The Qur'an mentions \nsome of the things which Allah prohibited to them. The cause of \nprohibition, as we mentioned previously, was to punish them for their \ntransgressions and sins: \n\n¢ And to the Jews We forbade every animal with claws, and of oxen and \nsheep We have forbidden them their fat, except what is carried on their \nbacks or entrails or what is connected to the bone; thus did We \nrecompense them for their rebelliousness, and indeed We speak the \ntruth, & \n\n(Al-An‘am: 146) \n\nThese prohibitions applied to the Jews, and it may be assumed that the \nChristians were also supposed to observe them since the Injil declares that \nProphet “Isa (peace be upon him) did not come to abolish the Law of \nProphet Musa but to fulfill it. However, the Christians made permissible \nthings which had been prohibited in the Tawrah, although not abrogated in \nthe /njil. The Christians followed the teachings of Paul, who declared all \nfoods and drinks permissible with the sole exception of the flesh of animals \nsacrificed to idols,“ since \"to the pure everything is pure\". Accordingly, \nChristians permitted themselves the eating of pork, despite the fact that the \ntext of the Tawrah prohibits it to this day. \n\nThe Attitude of the Pre-Islamic Arabs \n\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs prohibited certain animals as being unclean, \ntogether with some other animals which were considered sacred and \n\n1. 1 Cor. 8: 4-10, 10: 19-29; Col. 2: 13-14, 16; | Tim. 4: 4-5. (Translator) \n\n2. Rom. 14: 14-17; Tit. 1: 15. (Translator) \n\n(33 } NST \n\n\n\ndedicated to their gods; we have already mentioned bahirah, sa'ibah, \n\nwasilah, and ham, which fall into the latter category. In contrast to this, they \n\npermitted many kinds of impure foods, such as the flesh of dead animals and \n\nflowing blood. \n\nIslam Permits What Is Wholesome \n\nThis was the state of the world in relation with food of animal origin at \n\nthe advent of Islam; excessiveness whether to eating or non-eating. Then \n\nAllah addressed all human beings saying; \n\n@ O mankind! Eat of what is permissible and good on earth, and do not \n\nfollow the footsteps of Satan; truly he is an open adversary to you. ® \n\n(Al-Baqarah: 168) \n\nThus He speaks to all the people on this globe, calling on them to eat of \n\nthe good things which He has provided for them on this vast, outspread \n\ntable, the earth, and not to follow the ways of Satan, who has made it \n\nalluring to some people to prohibit to themselves various wholesome things \n\nwhich Allah has made halal, thus leading them toward the pitfalls of \n\nself-destruction. Then Allah addresses the believers in particular saying, \n\n@O you who believe! Eat of the good things that We have provided for \n\nyou, and be thankful to Allah if it is He alone Whom you worship. \n\nIndeed, what He has forbidden to you is the flesh of dead animals and \n\nblood and the flesh of swine, and that which has been sacrificed to \n\nanyone other than Allah. But if one is compelled by necessity, neither \n\ncraving (it) nor transgressing, there is no sin on him; indeed, Allah is \n\nEver Forgiving, Ever Merciful. ® \n\n(Al-Bagarah: 172-173) \n\nIn this particular message to the believers, Allah (Glory be to Him) tells \n\nthem to eat of the good things of His providing and to give thanks to Him \n\nfor His favors, He then explains that no food is haram to them except the \n\nfour kinds mentioned in the verse. The same four kinds, with some further \n\ndetails, are mentioned at other places in the Qur'an: \n\n@ Say: I do not find in what is revealed to me anything prohibited to an \n\neater in his food unless it be carrion, or flowing blood, or the flesh of \n\nswine, for that is indeed foul, or the abomination which has been \n\nG» NZ \n\n\n\ndedicated to anyone other than Allah. But if one is compelled by \nnecessity, neither craving (it) nor transgressing, then, indeed, thy Lord is \n\nEver Forgiving, Ever Merciful. » \n\n(Al-An’ am: 145) \n\nAnd in even greater detail: \n\n# Forbidden to you are the flesh of dead animals and blood and the flesh \nof swine, and that which has been dedicated to any other than Allah, and \nthat which has been killed by strangling or by beating or by falling or by \nbeing gored, and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild beast \nexcept that which you make lawful by slaughtering (before its death), \nand that which has been sacrificed to idols... > \n\n(Al-Ma’idah: 3) \n\nThere is no contradiction between this verse, which lists ten prohibited \ncategories, and the previous verse which lists four, since animals which are \nkilled by strangulation, by a blow, by a fall, by being gored, or which are \npartly eaten by wild animals are all included in the category of dead \nanimals. Similarly, what is sacrificed to idols falls into the category of that \nwhich is dedicated to anyone other than Allah. Accordingly, the foods \nwhich are prohibited fall into four broad categories which may be \nreclassified into ten detailed categories, as follows: \n\nThe Prohibition of Eating What Is Dead and Its Wisdom \n\nThe first thing mentioned in these verses concerning prohibited foods is \nthe flesh of \"dead animals,” that is, the beast or fowl which dies of natural \ncauses, without being slaughtered or hunted by men. There are obvious \nreasons for this prohibition: \n\na. Eating the flesh of a dead animal is repugnant to civilized taste and is \nconsidered by thinking people in all societies to be contrary to human \ndignity. We also observe that all peoples possessing a divinely revealed \nscripture have prohibited it and that they do not eat the flesh of an animal \nunless it is slaughtered. However, the methods of slaughter may vary. \n\nb. In whatever he does, the Muslim acts with a set purpose and intention; he \ndoes not use a thing nor reap its benefit without directing his intention, \naim, and effort toward it. The significance of slaughtering, which is a \n\nNZ \n\n\n\npurposeful act, and the intention of which ts to take the life of the animal \n\nin order to use it as food is to remove the slaughtered animal from the \n\ncategory of “dead animals”. Allah (Glory be to Him) does not desire that \n\nman should eat of what he did not intend or think of eating as is the case \n\nwith the dead animal: conversely, slaughtering an animal or hunting it as \n\ngame both require an intention followed by effort and subsequent action. \n\nc. If the animal died naturally, it is quite likely that it died of some acute or \n\nchronic discase, through eating a poisonous plant, or other similar \n\ncauses; hence eating its flesh would probably be harmful. The same ts \n\nthe case when the cause of death is old age or starvation. \n\nd. By prohibiting the flesh of a dead animal to human beings, Allah in His \n\nmercy provides a source of food to animals and birds, that, in the words \n\nof the Qur'an. constitute communities (wiman) like ourselves. The truth \n\nof this is demonstrated by the fact that carcasses of animals lying out in \n\nthe open are devoured by birds and animals. \n\ne. This prohibition encourages the owner of an animal to guard it from \n\ndisease and malnutrition lest it die and be wasted. Accordingly, in the \n\ncase of disease. he will be quick to seek a cure for it or will hasten to \n\nslaughter the animal. \n\nThe Prohibition of Flowing Blood \n\nThe second prohibition relates to flowing or liquid blood.'” Ibn “Abbas \n\nwas asked about the spleen and he replied, \"You can eat it\". The questioners \n\nsaid, \"But it is blood”? He answered, \"Only flowing blood is prohibited to \n\nyou. The reason for this prohibition is both that the drinking of blood 1s \n\nrepugnant to human decency and that it may likewise be injurious to health. \n\nDuring the period of Jahiliyvah, a person who felt hungry might jab a \n\nbone or a sharp object into the flesh of his animal, and collect and drink the \n\nflowing blood. \n\nThus, since piercing the flesh of a living animal injures and weakens it. \n\nAllah (Glorified be He) prohibited such a practice. \n\nL. fis not prohibited to eat the blood that remains in the flesh of the slaughtered animal after one \n\nhas done one’s best to remove i. (Pranslator) \n\n2. In early times the spleen was believed to be congealed blood. (Translator)\n\n\n\nPork \n\nThe third prohibited food is pork, that is, the flesh of swine. Since the \n\npig relishes filth and offal, this meat is repugnant to persons of decent taste; \nmoreover, recent medical research has shown that eating swine-flesh is \ninjurious to health in all climates, especially hot ones. Scientific research \nhas also shown that pork carries a deadly parasite (trichina), among others \nand perhaps science may discover in the future what will shed more light on \nthe wisdom of this prohibition. Allah Almighty spoke the truth in describing \nHis Messenger, Muhammad (pbuh) as the one who @ forbids them the wicked \nthings, » (Al-A’raf: 157). \n\nIn addition to this, there are also some scholars who say that eating pork \n\nfrequently diminishes the human being's sense of shame in relation to what \nis indecent. \n\nThat Which Is Dedicated to Anyone Other Than Allah \n\nThe fourth prohibited category refers to an animal which is dedicated to \nanyone other than Allah, that is to say, one which is slaughtered with the \ninvocation of a name other than the name of Allah - for example, the name \n\nof an idol. When slaughtering an animal, the Arab polytheists would invoke \n\nthe names of their idols, such as Al-Lat or Al-‘Uzza. Such a practice is a \ndevotional act addressed to other than Allah and is a form of worship in \nwhich His glorious Name is not mentioned. In this case the reason for the \nprohibition is entirely related to faith: to safeguard the belief in the Oneness \nof Allah, to purify worship, and to fight shirk and polytheism in whatever \nform they may be expressed. \n\nIndeed, it is Allah Who created man and gave him control over \neverything on the earth, subjecting animals to his power and permitting him \nto take their lives for food on condition that His name be pronounced at the \ntime of slaughter. Pronouncing the Name of Allah while slaughtering an \nanimal is a declaration that one is taking the life of this creature by the \npermission of its Creator, while if one invokes any other name, he has \n\nforfeited this permission and must be denied the use of its flesh. \n\n\n\nTypes of Dead Animals \nThe preceding are the four principle categories of prohibited animal \n\nfoods. As revealed in the verse of Surat al-Ma'idah (verse, 3), to these four \n\nare added five other categories which pertain to further classifications of the \n\n\"dead animal,” as follows: \n\n5. The strangled: an animal which has been strangled, for example, by a \n\nrope around its neck, or suffocated, as for instance by putting its head \n\ninto something which produces suffocation. \n\n6. The beaten: an animal which has been beaten to death by a club or similar \n\nobject. \n\n7. The fallen: an animal which dies as a result of a fall from a high place, or \n\nby falling into a gully or ravine. \n\n8. The gored: an animal which dies as a result of being gored by the horns \n\nof another animal. \n\n9. That which has been (partly) eaten by wild beasts: an animal which has \n\nbeen partially devoured by wild animals and dies as a result. \n\nAfter naming these five categories, Allah makes an exception of \"that \n\nwhich you make lawful by slaughtering,\" meaning that if one comes upon such \n\nan animal while it is still alive, slaughtering renders it halal as food. The \n\ncorrect understanding of \"still alive” is that some sign of life remains in it. \n\n~Ali Ibn Abi Talib said, \"If you can slaughter a beaten, a fallen, or a gored \n\nanimal while it (still) moves its hoof or leg, you may eat it.\" Ad-Dahhak \n\ncommented, \"The people of the time of Jahiliyyah used to eat them (dead \n\nanimals); then Allah prohibited them in Islam, excepting what is \n\nslaughtered. If it is slaughtered while it (still) moves a leg, a tail, or an eye, \n\nit is halal.) \n\nReasons for the Prohibition of the Foregoing Categories \n\nThe reason why the forgoing categories are prohibited is what we \n\nmentioned concerning animals that die naturally, with the exception of the \n\npossible expectation of the danger to health, which is not clear in such \n\n1. Some jurists have held that there must be life in it, the signs of which are the flow of blood and \n\nreflex movements. \n\n\n\ncases. However, we wish to cmphasize again the significance of \nprohibitions 5 through 9 above. The All-Wise Law-Giver wants to teach \npeople to be kind to the animal and to protect it from harm. One should not \nneglect it until it is strangled, falls from a high place, or is gored in a fight \nwith other animals, nor torture it by severe beating, possibly resulting in its \ndeath. as vicious herdsmen, particularly the hired ones, sometimes do, even \ngoading animals such as two bulls or sheep to fight each other until one \nwounds or gores the other to death. \n\nIt is solely for this reason that Muslim jurists have prohibited the eating \nof the flesh of an animal which has been gored to death, even if it was \nwounded by the horns of the other and its blood has flowed: this prohibition \nholds even if the blood flowed from a wound in the usual site of slaughter, \nthe throat. According to my understanding, the purpose behind this is to \npenalize the owner of such animals who has left them unattended to gore \neach other to death; he is not to be rewarded for this negligence by being \npermitted to make use of their flesh for food. \n\nThe reason for prohibiting the eating of animals partially devoured by \nwild beasts is to preserve human dignity; a Muslim is not to degrade himself \nby eating the leavings of animals. The people of the period of Jahilivyah \nwere in the habit of eating what had been left by wild animals, whether of \nsheep, camel. or cow, but subsequently Allah prohibited this to the \nbelievers. \n\nAnimal Sacrifices \n\nThe tenth category of prohibited animal food is that which has been \nsacrificed to idols. During the period of Jahiliyyah, stone altars stood in \nfront of the idols around the Kabah, and the polytheists would slaughter \nanimals on or Close to these altars in order to seek nearness to the deities to \nwhich the altars were assigned. \n\nSuch immolation is similar to that which is dedicated to any other than \nAllah, as both involve the glorification of false deities. The difference is that \nin case of that which was dedicated to other than Allah, the slaughtering \nmight not take place in the vicinity of the idol and only its name was \nmentioned over the object of sacrifice, while in. the latter case the\n\n\n\nimmolation was done in front of the idol or on the altar assigned to it, and it \n\nwas therefore unnecessary to mention its name. \n\nSince these altars were in the vicinity of the Kabah, it was possible to \n\nimagine that these sacrifices were meant to render homage to the Sacred \n\nHouse. The Qur'an, by an explicit declaration, removed this possibility from \n\nthe minds of people, classifying this practice under the same category as \n\nthat which is dedicated to anyone other than Allah. \n\nThe Exemption of Sea Food and Locusts \n\nThe Islamic Shari‘ah has exempted fish, whales, and other sea creatures \n\nfrom the category of \"dead animals\". When the Prophet (pbuh) was asked \n\nabout the sea, he replied, \n\n\"Its water is pure and its dead is lawful. m1) \n\nSays Allah (Glorified be He), \n\n@ The game of the sea is permitted to you and so is tts food... ® \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 96) \n\n“Umar explained, ¢ /ts game» is what is caught from it and g its food » is what \n\nis thrown out from it,” while Ibn “Abbas said, élts food > is its dead (animals)\". \n\nIn the two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, it is narrated on the \n\nauthority of Jabir that the Prophet (pbuh) once sent some of his Companions \n\non an expedition. They found a dead whale by the sea and subsisted on it for \n\nmore than twenty days. On their return to Madinah, they told the Prophet \n\n(pbuh) about this and he said, \n\n\"Eat the food which Allah has brought forth for you, and feed us from it \n\nif you have any left.\" \n\nThey then brought him some whale meat and he ate it. \n\nBy the same token, locusts are exempted from the category of \"dead \n\nanimals”. The Prophet (pbuh) permitted the eating of dead locusts, since the \n\nquestion of slaughtering them does not arise. Said ibn Abu Awfa, \"We went \n\nwith the Prophet (pbuh) on seven expeditions, and we ate locusts with him.\" \n\n1. Narrated by Ahmad and other compilers of the Sunnah. \n\n2. Narrated by Al-Bukhari. \n\n3. Narrated by all the authentic collections of hadiths except that of Ibn Majah. \n\nmm ) \n\n\n\nMaking Use of the Skin, Bones, and Hair of the Dead \nAnimal \n\nThe prohibition concerning the dead animal is limited to the eating of its \nflesh. One can - in fact, one should - make use of its skin, horns, bones, and \nhair, for throwing them away is a waste, and waste is not permitted. \nConcerning this, Ibn “Abbas narrated, \"The freed maid-servant of \nMaymunah, the Prophet's wife, was given a sheep, and it died. The Prophet \n(pbuh) passed by its carcass and said, ‘Why do you not take its skin to be tanned \nand used?’ They replied, ‘But it is dead.' The Prophet (pbuh) said, ‘What is \nprohibited is the eating.'\"\"\") \n\nThe Prophet (pbuh) made it clear that the way to purify the skin of a \ndead animal is to tan it. He is reported to have said, \n\n\"The tanning of the skin is its slaughtering,\" \n\nmeaning that just as slaughtering makes the eating of the flesh of a sheep or \ncow halal, likewise tanning makes the use of the skin halal. \n\nHe also said, \n\n\"Tanning removes its impurity,\" \n\nand \n\n\"If the skin is tanned, it is purified.\" \n\nThe application of these latter hadiths is quite general, including the skin \nof the dog or the pig. This was the opinion of the jurists of the Zahiri school, \nof Abu Yusuf, the disciple of Abu Hanifah, and of Ash-Shawkani. Sawdah, \nthe wife of the Prophet (pbuh) said, “One of our sheep died, so we tanned its \nskin and used it as a waterskin, putting dates in it to sweeten the water. We \nused it until it wore out.\"©) \n\n1. Narrated by all the authentic collections of hadiths except that of Ibn Majah. \n2. Narrated by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. \n\n3. Narrated by Al-Hakim. \n\n4. Narrated by Muslim and others. \n\n5. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and others.\n\n\n\nExceptions Dictated by Necessity \n\nAll the above-mentioned prohibitions apply in situations in which one \n\nhas a choice. However, in case of a necessity a different rule applies, as was \n\ndiscussed earlier. Allah (Glorified be He) says, \n\né... He has explained to you what He has made haram for you, except \n\nthat to which you are compelled... ® \n(Al-An‘am: 119) \n\nAnd after mentioning the prohibitions concerning the flesh of dead \n\nanimals, blood, and so, He says, \n\n& Whosoever is constrained, neither being inequitable nor aggressive, \n\nthen no sin is on him; indeed, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful. » \n\n(Al-Bagarah: 173) \n\nThe jurists unanimously agree that necessity in this case signifies the \n\nneed for food to alleviate hunger when no food is available. Some jurists \n\nhold the opinion that at least one day and one night should pass without \n\nfood. In such a situation a person may eat as much will satisfy his hunger \n\nand thus save himself from death. Imam Malik said, \"The amount of it is \n\nwhat will alleviate his hunger, and he should not eat more than what will \n\nkeep him alive.\" This, perhaps, is the meaning of Allah's words, “neither \n\ncraving (it) nor transgressing,\" - that is, neither desiring it nor eating more \n\nthan necessary. That hunger can be a compelling need is expressly \n\nmentioned in the Qur'anic verse: \n\n@... And whosoever is constrained in scantiness, without any indication \n\nto vice, then indeed Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful. » \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 3) \n\nMedical Necessity \n\nConcerning the question of whether some of the prohibited food \n\nsubstances can be used as medicine, there is a difference of opinion among \n\njurists. Some do not consider medicine to belong to the category of a \n\ncompelling necessity like food, and in support of their position they cite the \n\nhadith: \n\n\n\n“\"Assuredly Allah did not provide a cure for you in what He has \n\nprohibited to you.\"\")) \n\nOthers consider the need for medicine equal to that of food, as both are \n\nnecessary for preserving life. In support of their position that prohibited \nfood substances may be used as medicine, they argue that the Prophet \n(pbuh) allowed “Abd ar-Rahman ibn “Awf and Az-Zubayr ibn al-- Awwam \nto wear silk because they were suffering from scabies.” \n\nPerhaps this latter view is closer to the spirit of Islam which, in all its \nlegislations and teachings, is concerned with the preservation of human life. \nHowever, taking medicine containing some of the haram substances is \npermissible only under the following conditions: \n\n|. The patient's life is endangered if he does not take this medicine. \n\n2. No alternative or substitute medication made from entirely halal sources \nis available. \n\n3. The medication is prescribed by a Muslim physician who is \n\nknowledgeable as well as Allah-fearing. \n\nWe may, however, add that on the basis of our own observations and the \n\nopinions of expert physicians, we have arrived at the conclusion that there \n\nhardly exists any medical necessity which requires ingesting what is haram \nas a medicine. Nevertheless, we have stated this principle in case a Muslim \nhappens to be in a place where he cannot find medications other than those \nwhich contain haram substances. \n\nNecessity Does Not Exist If the Society Possesses Excess \nFood \n\nConsider a situation in which an individual does not have enough to eat \nbut other people, Muslims or dhimmis, in his community have excess food. \nIn such a case he does not fulfill the stipulation of being in a state of \nnecessity and consequently haram foods do not become permissible to him, \nfor an Islamic community is like a single body supporting its members or \nlike a fortified wall in which each brick strengthens the other. \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Mas ud. \n\n2. The text of this hadith is quoted in the section entitled \"Clothing and Ornaments\". \n\n\n\nThe concept of social solidarity is expressed very forcefully by the great \n\njurist Imam fbn Hazm, who said, \n\n“The Muslim is not in a state of necessity such that it becomes \n\npermissible for him to eat the flesh of dead animals or swine as long as \n\nsomeone else, whether a Muslim or a dhimmi, has excess food. It is \n\nobligatory on the person having food to feed the one who is hungry, and that \n\nbeing the cuse. the hungry person is not compelled to resort to the flesh of \n\ndead animals or swine. If the person having excess food denies it to him, he \n\nhas a right to fight for it. If he (the hungry person) is killed, the killer is \n\nguilty of murder and consequently subject to qisas (retaliation), while if he \n\nkills the denier of food he has dispatched him to the curse of Allah, as he \n\ndenied him his right and was one of the rebellious. Allah (Glorified be He) \n\nsays. \n\na And if one of them transgresses against the other, fight against the one \n\nwho transgresses until he complies with the command of Allah. \n\n(Al-Hujurat: 9) \n\nOne who denies the rights of his brother is a rebel against Allah. That is \n\nwhy Abu Bakr fought against those who refused to pay Zakah (while \n\nprofessing to be Muslims).\"\"? \n\n1. Ibn Hazm, Al-Muhailla, vol. 6, p. 159. \n\n\n\nThe Islamic Manner of Slaughtering \n\nAll Marine Animals Are Halal \n\nDepending on their habitats, animals are of two kinds: either marine or \n\nterrestrial. Marine animals, that is, those which live in water and cannot \n\nsurvive outside it, are all halal. It does not matter in what way they are \n\nobtained: whether they are taken out of the water dead or alive, whole or in \n\npieces, whether they are fish or marine animals, whether they are called sea \n\ndogs or sea hogs, or whether they are caught by a Muslim or a non-Muslim. \n\nAllah, the Most Generous, has opened wide the gates of His bounty upon \n\nHis worshipers by permitting them to eat all marine animals, without the \n\nrequirement of bleeding; man has been left free to catch them in whatever \n\nmanner he is able, avoiding any unnecessary cruelty as far as possible. \n\nReminding us of His favors, Allah (Glorified be He) says, \n\n@ And it is He Who has subjected the sea (to you) in order that you may \n\neat fresh meat from it... » \n\n(An-Nahl: 14) \n\n@ The game of the sea is permitted to you and so is its food, a provision \n\nfor you and for travelers by sea... ® \n\n(Al-Ma'idah: 96) \n\nPraise be to Allah for not having excluded anything, for 4 Thy Lord is not \n\nforgetful » (Maryam: 64). \n\nProhibited Terrestrial Animals \n\nAs far as terrestrial or land animals are concerned, Allah has prohibited \n\nonly the eating of pork, the flesh of any animal which dies naturally or is \n\nsacrificed to anyone other than Allah, and the drinking of blood. These \n\nprohibitions are explicitly mentioned in the text of the Qur'an, comprising, \n\nas we have seen, four major and ten minor categories. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, the Qur'an says concerning the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), \n\n&He ... makes lawful to them what is good and makes unlawful what is \n\nfoul... & (AI-A raf: 157) \n\nFoul things are those which, although some individuals may like, people \n\ngenerally find detestable. As an instance of this, on the day of the \n\nconfrontation of Khaybar, the Prophet (pbuh) forbade the eating of the flesh \n\nof domesticated donkeys.'” \n\nAnother example of the same thing is provided by a hadith narrated by \n\nboth Al-Bukhari and Muslim, which states that the Prophet (pbuh) “forbade \n\nthe eating of any wild animal with a canine tooth and any bird with talons”. \"Wild \n\nanimals\" denotes those which prey on others and devour them tearing them \n\napart, e.g., the lion, leopard, wolf, and the like; birds with talons such as the \n\nhawk, eagle, falcon, etc., do the same. \n\nAccording to Ibn “Abbas, nothing is haram other than the four \n\ncategories mentioned in the Qur'an, while what the Prophet (pbuh) forbade, \n\nsuch as beasts of prey, are to be regarded as makruh (detestable) rather than \n\nreaching the degree of haram. Said ibn ~ Abbas, \n\n\"The people of the time of Jahiliyyah ate certain foods and avoided \n\nothers, according to their whim. Then Allah sent His Prophet (pbuh) and \n\nrevealed His Book, and He legislated what is permissible and what is \n\nprohibited. Accordingly, what He permitted is halal, what He prohibited iS \n\nharam, and that concerning which He was silent is allowed.\" \n\nIbn “Abbas then recited, \n\n@ Say: I do not find in what is revealed to me anything prohibited to an \n\neater in his food... ® \n(Al-An’am: 145) \n\nOn the basis of this verse, Ibn “Abbas argued that the flesh of \n\ndomesticated donkeys is permissible. Imam Malik agrees with him on this \n\nmatter, considering beasts of prey makruh rather than haram. \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari. Concerning this hadith, it is said that the prohibition of eating donkeys \n\nwas temporary due to an emergency, as donkeys were needed for riding. This is similar to a sit- \n\nuation where, due to a shortage of meat, a government may forbid the slaughtering of young an- \n\nimals so they may grow bigger, or the hunting of deer a in particular season, etc. \n\n2. Narrated by Abu Dawud as a saying of Ibn “Abbas. \n\n\n\nThe jurists agree that cutting the throat of a prohibited animal does not \nrender it halal. However, it then becomes permissible to use its skin without \nlanning it. \n\nThe Requirement of Slaughtering in the Islamic Manner \n\nLand animals which are permissible as food are of two kinds. The first \nconsists of those animals which are tame or domesticated, such as camels, \ncows, goats, poultry, and other fowl which are raised on a farm or in the \nhouse, while untamed and wild animals are of the second type. In order to \nrender their flesh halal, Islam requires that animals of the first category be \nslaughtered in the manner prescribed by Islam. \n\nThe Conditions of Islamic Slaughtering \n\nAccording to the Shari-ah, the legal purification of the flesh of animals \nrequires that the following conditions be met: \n\n1. The animal should be slaughtered by a sharp instrument which is \ncapable of making it bleed by severing blood vessels, even if the sharp \nobject is a stone or a piece of wood. ‘Adi ibn Hatim narrated that he said to \nthe Prophet (pbuh), \"O Messenger of Allah, we go hunting and sometimes \nwe do not have a knife with us. We may find a sharp rock or a plece of \nwood or a reed.\" The Prophet (pbuh) said, \n\n\"The object is to make it bleed with whatever you have and mention the \nName of Allah over it.) \n\n2. The slaughtering is to be done by cutting the throat of the animal or \nby piercing the hollow of the throat, causing its death. The best way 1s to cut \nthe windpipe, the gullet, and the two jugular veins. \n\nHowever, if it becomes impossible to slaughter the animal in the \nspecified manner, this second condition is cancelled; for example, the \n\n|. Narrated by Ahmad. Abu Dawud, An-Nasa’i, [bn Majah, Al-Hakim, and Ibn Hibban. \n2. Some jurists have cited further conditions, but we have omitted them as we did not find explicit \n\ntexts mentioning them. The slaughtering of animals is known instinctively to all people. and to \ngo into depth and detail concerning it does not accord with Islam, which keeps matters easy and \nsimple. These jurists have differed to a great extent concerning this matter: for example: is it \nnecessary to cut off all four parts - the windpipe, the gullet, and the two jugular veins - or only \nsome of them? Should the knife point downward or upward? Can the hand be raised before the \nslaughtering is completed or not? \n\n\n\nanimal may have fallen headlong into a well so that its throat is inaccessible, \n\nor it may become wild and start kicking and running. Such cases are treated \n\nin the manner of game animals and it is sufficient to wound the animal at \n\nany place to make it bleed. On the authority of Rafi’ ibn Khadij, both \n\nAl-Bukhari and Muslim narrated the former as narrating, \"We were on a \n\njourney with the Prophet (pbuh) when one of the camels bolted away. As \n\nthe people did not have a horse, a man shot an arrow which struck the camel \n\nand wounded it. The Prophet (pbuh) said, \n\n'These animals may behave like wild beasts. If any of them behaves like \n\nthis, treat it in this fashion.\" \n\n3. No name other than Allah's should be mentioned over the animal at \n\nthe time of slaughter; concerning this condition there is a consensus among \n\nall the jurists. The people of the time of Jahiliyyah sought to propitiate their \n\ndeities and idols by sacrificing animals to them, either by invoking their \n\nnames while slaughtering or by immolating them on altars specified for \n\nthem. As mentioned perviously, the Qur'an prohibited all this in the words, \n\n# Forbidden to you are ... that which has been dedicated to anyone other \n\nthan Allah ... and that which has been sacrificed to idols. ® \n\n(Al-Ma’'idah: 3) \n\n4. The name of Allah should be mentioned while slaughtering the \n\nanimal.) This is clear in Qur'anic texts and hadiths. Allah (Glorified be He) \n\nsays, \n\n@ Then eat of that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if \n\nvou really believe in His signs. & \n\n(Al-An’am: 118) \n\néAnd do not eat of that over which the name of Allah has not been \n\nmentioned, for truly that is impiety... ® \n\n(Al-An am: 121) \n\nAnd, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. \n\n2. The correct manner of mentioning the name of Allah at slaughtering is to say, \"Bismillah, Allahu \n\nAkbar\" (In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest). On this occasion the words \"Ar-Rahman \n\nar-Rahim\" (the Most Merciful, the Ever-Merciful) do not follow Bismillah as ordinarily done, \n\nsince slaughtering is not an act of mercy. (Translator) \n\n\n\n\"If the blood is drained (from the animcl) and the name of Allah has \n\nbeen mentioned over it, you may eat of it.“ \n\nThis case is further supported by other sound hadiths which state that \n\nAllah's name must be pronounced while hunting just before an arrow is shot \n\nor a hunting dog is sent for the chase. This point will be discussed later in \n\nthe section on hunting. \n\nSome scholars are of the opinion that although the name of Allah must \nbe mentioned, it is not necessary to mention it at the time of slaughtering the \nanimal; one can mention it at the time of eating, since in that case it cannot \n\nbe held that it was eaten without mentioning the name of Allah over it. In \nthe Sahih of Al-Bukhari we find a hadith narrated by “A'ishah, who said, \n\n\"Some people who had recently becotne Muslims said to the Prophet \n\n(pbuh), ‘People bring us meat and we do not know whether they have \nmentioned the name of Allah over it or not. Shall we eat of it or not?’ The \n\nProphet (pbuh) replied, ‘Mention the name of Allah (over it) and eat.\" \n\nThe Wisdom of the Islamic Manner of Slaughtering \n\nThe wisdom of the Islamic rules of slaughtering is to take the animal's \n\nlife in the quickest and most painless way; the requirements of using a sharp \n\ninstrument and of cutting the throat relate to this end. It is forbidden to rend \n\nthe throat by using teeth or nails since this will cause pain to the animal and \n\nis likely to strangle it. The Prophet (pbuh) recommended sharpening the \n\nknife and putting the animal at ease, saying, \n\n\"Allah has ordained kindness (or excellence) in everything. If killing is to \n\nbe done, do it in the best manner, and when you slaughter, do it in the best \n\nmanner by (first) sharpening the knife and putting the animal at ease.\" \n\nIn another hadith narrated by Ibn “Umar, the Prophet (pbuh) said, \n\n\"When one of you slaughters, let him complete it.“ \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and others. \n\n2. The correct invocation when one is about to start eating or drink is to say, \"Bismillah\" (in the \n\nName of Allah), in addition to a supplication such as “Allahumma Barik lana fi ma Razagtana \nwa Qina “Adhab an-Nar\" (O Allah! Please bless what you have provided for us and save us from \n\nthe punishment of the Fire!). (Translator) \n\n3. Narrated by Muslim on the authority of Shaddad ibn Aws. \n\n4. Narrated by Ibn Majah. \n\n\n\nBy this he (pbuh) meant that one should sharpen his knife well and feed, \n\nwater and soothe the animal before slaughtering. \n\nIbn ‘Abbas reported that once the Prophet (pbuh) saw a man. sharpening \n\nhis knife after laying down a sheep to be slaughtered. The Prophet (pbuh) \n\nrebuked him, saying, \n\n\"Do you intend to make it die twice? Why did you not sharpen your knife \n\nbefore laying it down?) \n\nOnce, ‘Umar saw a man dragging a sheep by its leg to be slaughtered. \n\nHe said, \"Woe to you! Lead it to its death in a decent manner.\" \n\nThus the main intent here is to be kind to the animal, which cannot \n\nexpress itself freely, and to spare it unnecessary suffering insofar as this is \n\npossible. The people of Jahiliyyah were fond of cutting off the humps of \n\nlive camels and the fat tails of live sheep in order to eat them. In order to put \n\na stop to this barbaric practice, the Prophet (pbuh) forbade the eating of any \n\npart obtained in this fashion, saying, \n\n\"Any part cut off from a living animal is dead (flesh). 3) \n\nThe Significance of Mentioning Allah's Name \n\nMentioning the name of Allah to purify the act of slaughtering has a \n\nsubtle significance which we would do well to ponder. First, this practice is \n\nin opposition to the practice of the idolaters and the people of Jahiliyyah, \n\nwho mentioned the names of their non-existent deities while slaughtering \n\nanimals. Since the polytheist mentions the name of a false deity, how can \n\nthe Believer fail to mention the name of the true God? \n\nSecond, these animals, like human beings, are creatures of Allah, and \n\nlike them they have life. How then can a man take control of them and \n\ndeprive them of life unless he first obtains permission from his, and their, \n\ncommon Creator, to Whom everything belongs? Mentioning the name of \n\nAllah while slaughtering the animal is a declaration of this divine \n\n1. Narrated by Al-Hakim, who classified it as sahih according to the standard of Al-Bukhari. \n\n2. Narrated by “Abd ar-Razzaq. \n\n3, Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Hakim. \n\n\n\npermission, as if the one who is killing the animal were saying, \"This act of \nmine is not an act of aggression against the universe nor of oppression \nagainst this creature, but in the name of Allah I slaughter, in the name of \nAllah I hunt, and in the name of Allah I eat.” \n\nAnimals Slaughtered by the People of the Book \n\nWe have seen that Islam emphasizes that the animal must be slaughtered \nin a prescribed manner. The polytheists of Arabia and other nations had \nmade animal sacrifice an act of worship, or rather an integral part of their \nbelief system and a pillar of their religion, seeking to propitiate their deities \nby sacrificing animals either at their special altars or by mentioning their\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n","title":"the-lawful-and-the-prohibited-in-islam (1).pdf","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"4ce1c8d0-081b-4f55-bae3-952b7b7a340d","request_id":"90174662dd22fa27-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4ce1c8d0-081b-4f55-bae3-952b7b7a340d","children":["bdf1929b-ecf4-4c19-93a4-c087293af5a2"]},"bdf1929b-ecf4-4c19-93a4-c087293af5a2":{"id":"bdf1929b-ecf4-4c19-93a4-c087293af5a2","message":{"id":"bdf1929b-ecf4-4c19-93a4-c087293af5a2","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736791184.808535,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\nPlease remember to search the user's documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"command":"prompt","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"0abf17a2-50d8-4ef8-b070-b28e8663dad4","request_id":"90174662dd22fa27-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0abf17a2-50d8-4ef8-b070-b28e8663dad4","children":["6cdc3ca0-b730-4bf7-a85d-ff62eb405872"]},"6cdc3ca0-b730-4bf7-a85d-ff62eb405872":{"id":"6cdc3ca0-b730-4bf7-a85d-ff62eb405872","message":{"id":"6cdc3ca0-b730-4bf7-a85d-ff62eb405872","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736791184.808718,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### Analysis and Comparison of the Four-Layer Model with Islamic Principles\n\n#### **1. Awareness and Taqwa (Consciousness of Allah)**  \nThe transcript emphasizes awareness as foundational for self-improvement. In Islam, Taqwa—a profound consciousness of Allah—is similarly central. Allah says:\n> \"Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you\" [Quran 49:13](https://quran.com/49/13).  \nTaqwa includes self-awareness and accountability, aligning with the presenter's emphasis on introspection to understand one’s actions and intentions. This layer also resonates with **muraqabah** (self-monitoring), where one remains vigilant of their actions for the sake of Allah.\n\n#### **2. Mindset and Niyyah (Intention)**  \nThe model's second layer, mindset, reflects beliefs shaping cognition and actions. In Islam, **niyyah** is foundational:  \n> \"Actions are judged by intentions...\" (Sahih Bukhari and Muslim).  \nIslamic teachings emphasize shaping beliefs through Qur'anic understanding and Sunnah to guide cognition and action towards righteous ends. For example, correct beliefs about Tawhid (Oneness of Allah) underpin sincere actions and decisions.\n\n#### **3. Cognition and 'Aql (Reason)**  \nThe transcript’s focus on cognition parallels the Islamic principle of **'aql** (reason). Allah encourages reflection:\n> \"Do they not reflect upon themselves?\" [Quran 30:8](https://quran.com/30/8).  \nThe Islamic tradition views **'aql** as a gift, responsible for interpreting divine guidance and making ethical decisions. Decision-making in the transcript aligns with **ijtihad** (independent reasoning) used in Islamic jurisprudence, demonstrating the harmony between cognition and divine law.\n\n#### **4. Systems and Amal (Action)**  \nThe external systems described in the transcript resemble **amal** (action) in Islam. The Qur'an emphasizes that faith must translate into righteous deeds:\n> \"But those who believe and do righteous deeds will have the Gardens of Paradise as a lodging\" [Quran 18:107](https://quran.com/18/107).  \nIslam prescribes personal systems—such as daily prayers, zakat, and fasting—to cultivate discipline, spiritual growth, and societal welfare.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of \"Man on a Horse\" Analogy in Islamic Context  \n\nThe \"Man on a Horse\" analogy aligns closely with Islamic teachings about the **nafs** (soul) and **'aql** (intellect). The Qur'an identifies three levels of the soul:\n1. **Nafs al-Ammarah (Commanding Soul)**: Dominated by desires, akin to the horse taking control. Allah says, \"Indeed, the soul is prone to evil...\" [Quran 12:53](https://quran.com/12/53).\n2. **Nafs al-Lawwamah (Self-Reproaching Soul)**: Represents inner conflict and self-awareness.\n3. **Nafs al-Mutma'innah (Tranquil Soul)**: Achieved when the intellect ('aql) guides the soul, steering desires toward righteousness:  \n   > \"O reassured soul, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]\" [Quran 89:27-28](https://quran.com/89/27-28).\n\nThe analogy reflects the spiritual struggle (jihad al-nafs) to control one’s desires through awareness and discipline, as emphasized in Islamic ethics.\n\n---\n\n### Influence of Environment and Accountability in Islam  \n\nThe presenter highlights the role of genetics and environment in shaping habits. Islam acknowledges these influences but emphasizes individual accountability. Allah states:\n> \"Every soul earns only to its own account\" [Quran 6:164](https://quran.com/6/164).  \n\nWhile upbringing and societal factors impact behavior, Islam empowers individuals to rise above them through divine guidance and free will. For example, the Qur'an frequently cites the Prophets who overcame adverse environments (e.g., Prophet Yusuf’s resilience in a corrupt society).\n\n---\n\n### Constructing Islamic Personal Systems  \n\nIn Islam, personal systems are anchored in daily rituals and ethical routines that nurture spirituality and well-being:\n1. **Daily Salah (Prayers)**: Structures the day, fostering mindfulness and gratitude.  \n2. **Adhkar (Remembrance of Allah)**: Provides mental clarity and a heart-oriented focus.  \n3. **Zakah (Charity)**: Embeds accountability for wealth and compassion for others.  \n\nThe transcript’s systems for productivity align with **tawheed al-‘amal** (unity of purpose in action), ensuring actions align with divine pleasure.\n\n---\n\n### Self-Esteem and Islamic Concepts of Dignity  \n\nThe presenter links self-esteem to control over one’s \"horse.\" Islam views **izzah** (dignity) and self-worth as intrinsic to a believer who seeks divine pleasure:\n> \"Honor belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers\" [Quran 63:8](https://quran.com/63/8).  \n\nA Muslim’s self-esteem arises from servitude to Allah and adherence to moral conduct, not external validation.\n\n---\n\n### Actionable Plan for Muslims\n\n1. **Strengthen Awareness (Taqwa):**  \n   - Reflect daily on intentions and actions using **muhasabah** (self-accountability).  \n   - Recite the verse:  \n     > \"And those who strive for Us—We will surely guide them to Our ways\" [Quran 29:69](https://quran.com/29/69).\n\n2. **Refine Mindset (Niyyah):**  \n   - Regularly renew intentions before any action.  \n   - Study Qur'anic verses on belief and values to realign perspectives.\n\n3. **Enhance Cognition ('Aql):**  \n   - Engage in critical reflection using Islamic sources (Qur'an and Hadith).  \n   - Practice problem-solving through the lens of **maqasid al-shariah** (objectives of Islamic law).\n\n4. **Build Systems (Amal):**  \n   - Establish routines for Quran recitation, salah, and fasting.  \n   - Use modern productivity tools while adhering to Islamic ethics.\n\n---\n\n**Which part of this analysis would you like to explore further—Taqwa's connection to awareness, the spiritual struggle of nafs, or building a holistic Islamic system for self-improvement?**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop"},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-1C31tpBWa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"bdf1929b-ecf4-4c19-93a4-c087293af5a2","request_id":"90174662dd22fa27-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bdf1929b-ecf4-4c19-93a4-c087293af5a2","children":["aaa2b77b-862f-47b5-8c15-f0717ff1a699"]},"aaa2b77b-862f-47b5-8c15-f0717ff1a699":{"id":"aaa2b77b-862f-47b5-8c15-f0717ff1a699","message":{"id":"aaa2b77b-862f-47b5-8c15-f0717ff1a699","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736794028.497405,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I would like to explore all of them - Taqwa's connection to awareness, the spiritual struggle of nafs, and building a holistic Islamic system for self-improvement.

Taqwa's Connection to Awareness**\n\n**Taqwa** is derived from the root **وقى (waqaa)**, meaning to shield or protect oneself. In an Islamic context, it signifies a consciousness of Allah that motivates an individual to avoid sin and perform righteous deeds.\n\n**Awareness as the Root of Taqwa**  \n- Taqwa begins with **muraqabah** (self-awareness), the understanding that Allah observes all actions:  \n  > \"...And He is with you wherever you are. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing\" [Quran 57:4](https://quran.com/57/4).  \n\n- **Hadith Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ defined excellence in worship as:  \n  > \"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and though you do not see Him, know that He sees you\" (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim).  \n\n- **Practical Steps to Strengthen Taqwa Through Awareness**:\n  1. **Daily Reflection**: After prayers, ask, *\"Were my actions today pleasing to Allah?\"*  \n  2. **Journaling Intentions**: Begin the day by documenting your intentions and align them with Allah’s pleasure.  \n  3. **Dua for Guidance**: Consistently recite:  \n     > \"Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance\" [Quran 18:10](https://quran.com/18/10).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. The Spiritual Struggle of Nafs**\n\nThe struggle against the **nafs** (self) is central to Islamic spirituality. The Qur'an identifies three levels of the soul:\n1. **Nafs al-Ammarah (Commanding Soul)**: Dominated by base desires and inclinations to sin.  \n   - Allah warns:  \n     > \"Indeed, the soul is prone to evil, except those upon whom my Lord has mercy\" [Quran 12:53](https://quran.com/12/53).  \n\n2. **Nafs al-Lawwamah (Self-Reproaching Soul)**: Aware of its shortcomings and struggles for improvement.  \n   - Allah describes it as:  \n     > \"...and I swear by the self-reproaching soul\" [Quran 75:2](https://quran.com/75/2).  \n\n3. **Nafs al-Mutma'innah (Tranquil Soul)**: At peace due to submission to Allah’s will.  \n   - Allah says:  \n     > \"O tranquil soul, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing to Him\" [Quran 89:27-28](https://quran.com/89/27).  \n\n**Tools for Overcoming the Nafs**:\n- **Salah**: A direct confrontation with the nafs, particularly in the struggle to maintain focus and humility in prayer.  \n- **Fasting**: Teaches discipline, as one abstains not just from food but from vain talk and sinful behavior.  \n- **Dhikr**: Constant remembrance of Allah silences the nafs and aligns it with divine priorities.\n\n**Action Plan for Nafs Mastery**:  \n1. **Identify Weaknesses**: Use self-awareness to recognize when the nafs controls you (e.g., anger, greed).  \n2. **Develop Self-Control**: Fast regularly beyond Ramadan to tame desires.  \n3. **Combat Through Istighfar**: Seek forgiveness for lapses, reciting:  \n   > \"I seek forgiveness from Allah, the Almighty, Who is free from any imperfection and I repent to Him.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Building a Holistic Islamic System for Self-Improvement**\n\nIslam provides a framework for personal systems that integrate spirituality, discipline, and purpose. A holistic Islamic system encompasses three dimensions: belief, action, and moral refinement.\n\n**Dimension 1: Spiritual Awareness**\n- **Quranic Engagement**: Dedicate time to study and reflect on the Quran daily. Start with small passages and delve into tafsir (exegesis).  \n- **Establish Dhikr Practices**: Begin mornings with **SubhanAllah wa bihamdihi (Glory is to Allah and all praise is due to Him)**, which the Prophet ﷺ taught as a way to fill scales with good deeds.\n\n**Dimension 2: Practical Systems**\n- **Daily Routines for Salah**: Set alarms for salah with extra time to make wudu calmly and focus on the moment.  \n- **Organized Charity**: Allocate a percentage of income monthly for sadaqah. Use it to build consistency in helping others.  \n- **Mindful Productivity**: Adopt a digital system for organizing tasks. Integrate Islamic ethics into daily activities, like honesty in meetings or humility in leadership.\n\n**Dimension 3: Emotional and Moral Refinement**\n- **Forgiveness and Gratitude**: Practice forgiving those who wrong you, as Allah loves pardoners:  \n  > \"...and pardon people, and Allah loves the doers of good\" [Quran 3:134](https://quran.com/3/134).  \n\n- **Serve Others**: Actively participate in community service. Reflect on the Hadith:  \n  > \"The best of people are those that bring the most benefit to the rest of mankind\" (Daraqutni).  \n\n---\n\n### Integration of Taqwa, Nafs, and Systems\n\nTo integrate these dimensions effectively:  \n1. **Awareness of Allah (Taqwa)**: Begin each day with the intention to serve Allah. Repeat:  \n   > \"Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my death are for Allah\" [Quran 6:162](https://quran.com/6/162).  \n\n2. **Battle the Nafs**: During moments of weakness, pause and recite:  \n   > \"And those who strive for Us—We will surely guide them to Our ways\" [Quran 29:69](https://quran.com/29/69).  \n\n3. **Systematize Growth**: Develop habits like consistent Qur'an study, structured charity, and disciplined work routines.\n\n---\n\nWhich specific aspect would you like deeper practical examples for—spiritual practices, refining the nafs, or actionable systems to implement in daily life?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop"},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-1C31tpBWa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa2b77b-862f-47b5-8c15-f0717ff1a699","request_id":"90178d8c495bead7-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2b77b-862f-47b5-8c15-f0717ff1a699","children":["aaa2f9f6-7331-4d28-8d92-d4cd25965ee2"]},"aaa2f9f6-7331-4d28-8d92-d4cd25965ee2":{"id":"aaa2f9f6-7331-4d28-8d92-d4cd25965ee2","message":{"id":"aaa2f9f6-7331-4d28-8d92-d4cd25965ee2","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736794389.599045,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I would like deeper practical examples for all of them. spiritual practices, refining the nafs,  and actionable systems to implement in daily life."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9017965feb7aead7-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fc15cacb-4732-450e-be76-b1f6459aa2bc","children":["70bf1cea-b7ce-4f61-95cb-7fbc91c3b828"]},"70bf1cea-b7ce-4f61-95cb-7fbc91c3b828":{"id":"70bf1cea-b7ce-4f61-95cb-7fbc91c3b828","message":{"id":"70bf1cea-b7ce-4f61-95cb-7fbc91c3b828","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736794469.963948,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### Deeper Practical Examples for Spiritual Practices, Refining the Nafs, and Daily Life Systems\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Spiritual Practices: Strengthening Taqwa and Awareness**\n\n**Daily Quran Engagement**  \n- **Practical Example**:  \n  - Dedicate 10 minutes after Fajr salah daily to recite a short portion of the Quran. Begin with **Surah Al-Fatihah** and **Juz ‘Amma**.\n  - Reflect on a single verse using a tafsir such as Tafsir Ibn Kathir or Ma’ariful Quran. For instance, reflect on:  \n    > \"Guide us to the straight path\" [Quran 1:6](https://quran.com/1/6) and journal what \"straight path\" means in your current context.  \n\n**Morning and Evening Adhkar (Remembrances)**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Use a pocket-sized booklet or an app like Hisnul Muslim (Fortress of the Muslim). After Fajr and Maghrib, recite:  \n    - **SubhanAllah wa bihamdihi, SubhanAllah al-‘Azim** (Glory is to Allah, and all praise is due to Him).  \n    - **Astaghfirullah wa atubu ilayh** (I seek forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance).  \n  - Reflect on how these words align with your daily challenges.  \n\n**Salah with Khushu’ (Mindfulness)**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Before each prayer, remind yourself of the Hadith:  \n    > \"Pray as if you see Allah, and if you do not see Him, know that He sees you\" (Sahih Bukhari).  \n  - To enhance concentration:\n    - Read the translation of the surahs you will recite beforehand.\n    - Begin prayer with a whispered supplication such as:  \n      > \"O Allah, make my heart humble before You and my body obedient to You.\"\n\n**Weekly Reflection (Muhasabah)**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Dedicate 30 minutes every Friday to reflect on your week:\n    - What actions brought you closer to Allah?  \n    - What actions distanced you?  \n  - Journal and set goals for the upcoming week, pairing each with a dua.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Refining the Nafs: The Spiritual Struggle**\n\n**Recognize Weaknesses in the Nafs**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Identify one dominant weakness (e.g., anger, procrastination, or greed). For instance, if you struggle with anger, implement this three-step process:  \n    1. **Prevention**: Avoid triggers (e.g., stressful arguments).  \n    2. **Intervention**: When angry, recite:  \n       > \"I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaytan.\"  \n       If standing, sit; if sitting, lie down (Sunan Abu Dawood).  \n    3. **Reflection**: After the episode, perform wudu and pray two rak’ahs to calm your soul.\n\n**Build Discipline Through Fasting**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Beyond Ramadan, fast on Mondays and Thursdays as the Prophet ﷺ recommended (Sunan At-Tirmidhi).  \n  - Intend not just to abstain from food but also from speaking ill, wasting time, or succumbing to desires. Reflect on the Quranic verse:  \n    > \"...that you may learn self-restraint\" [Quran 2:183](https://quran.com/2/183).  \n\n**Replace Negative Habits with Positive Ones**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - For each harmful habit (e.g., gossip), replace it with a dhikr habit. Instead of engaging in unnecessary talk, say:  \n    - **SubhanAllahi wa bihamdihi, SubhanAllahil ‘Azim** (Glory is to Allah and all praise belongs to Him).  \n  - Record the number of repetitions daily to maintain focus and measure progress.\n\n**Seek Istighfar for Self-Reflection**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Recite **Astaghfirullah** 100 times daily, as recommended in the Sunnah. Reflect on one sin or weakness each time you say it and consciously resolve to improve.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Actionable Systems for Daily Life**\n\n**Morning Routine**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Begin your day with **Tahajjud (optional night prayer)**, even if it is just two rak’ahs.  \n  - After Fajr, recite the following duas for clarity and productivity:  \n    - \"O Allah, bless my morning and make it a source of goodness.\"  \n    - \"O Allah, make me grateful for Your blessings and conscious of Your guidance.\"\n\n**Daily Task Organization**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Use a \"3-goal system\":\n    1. Spiritual Goal: E.g., read one page of the Quran.  \n    2. Family Goal: E.g., spend quality time discussing a moral story with children.  \n    3. Professional Goal: E.g., complete one key work-related task with ihsan (excellence).  \n  - Organize these tasks using tools like a planner or digital apps, such as Notion or Todoist.\n\n**Charity and Social Responsibility**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Set aside a small portion of income weekly for sadaqah. Even $1/day can help create consistency.  \n  - Volunteer at least once a month in your community. Reflect on the Hadith:  \n    > \"The most beloved of people to Allah are those who bring the most benefit to others\" (Daraqutni).\n\n**Evening Reflection and Dua**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Before sleeping, perform wudu and pray two rak’ahs.  \n  - Recite:  \n    > \"O Allah, forgive my sins, guide me to righteousness, and make my sleep a means of rejuvenation for worship.\"  \n  - Write down three things you are grateful for that day, connecting each to Allah’s mercy.\n\n**Weekly Islamic Studies**  \n- **Practical Example**:\n  - Dedicate one hour every weekend to studying a specific topic:\n    - Tafsir of a surah.\n    - Lives of the Prophets.\n    - A Hadith compilation like Riyad as-Salihin.  \n  - Discuss what you learn with family or friends to reinforce understanding and application.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Implementation Framework for Long-Term Growth\n1. **Week 1**: Focus on awareness (Taqwa). Start daily Quran recitation and journaling intentions.  \n2. **Week 2**: Tackle one aspect of the nafs. For example, practice patience by fasting or controlling anger.  \n3. **Week 3**: Introduce systems for productivity. Begin by organizing tasks around salah times.  \n4. **Ongoing**: Assess progress weekly. Seek guidance through dua, and remain flexible to adapt your routine as needed.\n\n---\n\nWhich of these practices would you like to prioritize in your daily life, or would you like assistance in tailoring this framework to your specific challenges?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop"},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-1C31tpBWa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa2f9f6-7331-4d28-8d92-d4cd25965ee2","request_id":"9017965feb7aead7-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2f9f6-7331-4d28-8d92-d4cd25965ee2","children":["aaa2872a-6561-43e5-a029-8b474e77f006"]},"aaa2872a-6561-43e5-a029-8b474e77f006":{"id":"aaa2872a-6561-43e5-a029-8b474e77f006","message":{"id":"aaa2872a-6561-43e5-a029-8b474e77f006","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737322355.73258,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["My specific challenge is that I have ADHD and it's very hard for me to form habits. and so at 32 years of age I find. myself trying to. turn back to Allah, "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9049f02ecbede825-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"70bf1cea-b7ce-4f61-95cb-7fbc91c3b828","children":["4f33ff3e-a8a7-4ff9-a2ad-b39e90702a3d"]},"4f33ff3e-a8a7-4ff9-a2ad-b39e90702a3d":{"id":"4f33ff3e-a8a7-4ff9-a2ad-b39e90702a3d","message":{"id":"4f33ff3e-a8a7-4ff9-a2ad-b39e90702a3d","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737322400.963098,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":0,"metadata":{"rebase_system_message":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa2872a-6561-43e5-a029-8b474e77f006","request_id":"9049f02ecbede825-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2872a-6561-43e5-a029-8b474e77f006","children":["cff9e455-dd79-4d4d-a818-20b31f36a41b"]},"cff9e455-dd79-4d4d-a818-20b31f36a41b":{"id":"cff9e455-dd79-4d4d-a818-20b31f36a41b","message":{"id":"cff9e455-dd79-4d4d-a818-20b31f36a41b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737322400.963314,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Raheem.\n\nAlhamdulillah, your desire to turn back to Allah is a profound step and a sign of His mercy upon you. The challenges posed by ADHD can make habit formation difficult, but Islam offers flexibility, simplicity, and a system that adapts to individual needs. Let’s approach this step by step, keeping your unique situation in mind.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding Your Journey Back to Allah**\nRecognize that Allah appreciates every effort you make, no matter how small:  \n> \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it\" [Quran 99:7](https://quran.com/99/7).\n\nThe fact that you are striving despite challenges is a form of jihad (struggle) that carries immense reward. The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n> \"The deeds most loved by Allah are those done consistently, even if they are few\" (Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Tailoring Practices for ADHD**\nADHD makes structure challenging, so focus on **micro-habits**—small, manageable actions that don't overwhelm.\n\n#### **Start Small: Prioritize 3 Practices**\n1. **Daily Salah (Even If Incomplete):**\n   - Begin with one prayer (e.g., Maghrib or Fajr). Use phone reminders or a **physical prayer chart** to track.\n   - Simplify the process by preparing in advance—make wudu earlier, keep a prayer mat accessible, and start with a short surah you know.\n\n2. **Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah):**\n   - Use a physical tasbih (prayer beads) or an app to track **simple adhkar** like \"SubhanAllah wa bihamdihi\" 10 times after salah or during idle moments.\n\n3. **Quran Connection:**\n   - Commit to **one verse per day**. Apps like Quran.com can send daily verses with translation. Reflect on the meaning briefly.\n\n#### **Use ADHD-Friendly Tools**:\n- **Visual Cues**: Place sticky notes with Islamic reminders around your home or phone.\n- **Timers**: Set short timers (e.g., 3-5 minutes) for activities like salah or Quran, to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Emotional Connection with Allah**\nReconnecting with Allah is as much about the heart as actions. Use your emotions as a strength.\n\n- **Make Personal Duas**: Speak to Allah in your own words about your struggles. Say:  \n  > \"O Allah, help me form habits to please You. I am weak, but You are strong. Draw me closer to You.\"  \n  The Prophet ﷺ said:  \n  > \"Call upon Allah while being certain of being answered\" (Tirmidhi).\n\n- **View Setbacks as a Test**: ADHD might make routines harder, but Allah rewards effort, not perfection:  \n  > \"And those who strive for Us—We will surely guide them to Our ways\" [Quran 29:69](https://quran.com/29/69).  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Simplified Framework for Habit Formation**\nUsing ADHD strategies, build habits gradually:\n\n#### **Week 1**: Focus on Salah  \n- **Start with one prayer** consistently (e.g., Maghrib). Once stable, add more prayers one at a time.  \n- **Visualize success**: Place a note near your bed that says, \"Maghrib is your meeting with Allah.\"  \n\n#### **Week 2**: Add Dhikr  \n- Pair dhikr with existing habits (e.g., say **\"Astaghfirullah\"** while walking or cleaning).  \n\n#### **Week 3**: Connect with Quran  \n- Commit to **one verse** a day, using apps or audio if reading feels challenging.  \n\n#### Build Flexibility:  \n- If routines feel too rigid, **rotate activities** (e.g., do Quran on some days, dhikr on others). ADHD thrives on variety.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Emphasizing Reward and Mercy**\nFocus on **reward, not guilt**. Allah is the Most Merciful, and He values even the smallest step toward Him.  \n- **Celebrate wins**: After praying or doing dhikr, remind yourself: “Allah saw my effort, and He is pleased.”  \n- **Hadith for Hope**:  \n  > \"Take up good deeds only as much as you are able, for the best deeds are those done regularly, even if they are few\" (Sunan Ibn Majah).\n\n---\n\n### **6. ADHD-Specific Examples of Worship**\n\n#### **Spontaneous Acts of Worship**  \nADHD minds thrive in the moment. Take advantage of impulses to worship:  \n- See a beautiful sky? Say:  \n  > \"Rabbana ma khalaqta hatha batilan\" (Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly) [Quran 3:191](https://quran.com/3/191).  \n- Passing a masjid? Say:  \n  > \"Allahumma iftah li abwaba rahmatik\" (O Allah, open for me the doors of Your mercy).  \n\n#### **Physical Movement and Worship**  \n- ADHD brains often focus better with movement. Pair dhikr with activities like walking, cleaning, or exercising.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Long-Term Tips for Sustained Growth**\n1. **Find a Support Network**: Join an Islamic study circle (in-person or virtual) for ADHD-friendly encouragement.  \n2. **Use ADHD-Friendly Apps**:\n   - Apps like \"Muslim Pro\" or \"Pillars\" can send reminders for salah or adhkar.  \n3. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Progress will fluctuate, but Allah values your sincerity.\n\n---\n\n### **A Dua to Begin Your Journey**\n> \"O Allah, I seek Your help in remembering You, thanking You, and worshiping You in the best manner\" (Sunan Abu Dawood).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like specific templates for prayer charts, ADHD-friendly tools for Islam, or support strategies? Let's make this journey as simple and meaningful as possible for you, inshaAllah."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002,200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-1C31tpBWa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"4f33ff3e-a8a7-4ff9-a2ad-b39e90702a3d","request_id":"9049f02ecbede825-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4f33ff3e-a8a7-4ff9-a2ad-b39e90702a3d","children":["aaa20f15-dc72-4c62-9d55-e733e83dcc4f"]},"aaa20f15-dc72-4c62-9d55-e733e83dcc4f":{"id":"aaa20f15-dc72-4c62-9d55-e733e83dcc4f","message":{"id":"aaa20f15-dc72-4c62-9d55-e733e83dcc4f","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737326252.791711,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes, if you could make a specific template that I could then use to integrate into todoist along with my method of trying to implement the GTD methodology That would be extremely helpful."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"904a4f52eb01230f-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cff9e455-dd79-4d4d-a818-20b31f36a41b","children":["4c397ef5-0009-4b8b-9121-2db0f5cc0767"]},"4c397ef5-0009-4b8b-9121-2db0f5cc0767":{"id":"4c397ef5-0009-4b8b-9121-2db0f5cc0767","message":{"id":"4c397ef5-0009-4b8b-9121-2db0f5cc0767","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737326330.997158,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here’s a specific **Islamic Habit Formation Template** designed to integrate with your **Todoist app** and complement the **Getting Things Done (GTD)** methodology.
