You have two main options:\n\n### **✅ Option 1: One-Way Sync (Apple Reminders → Todoist)**\n- Apple Reminders **feeds tasks into Todoist**, but changes made in Todoist **won’t** sync back to Apple Reminders.\n- Works using **Apple Shortcuts** or **Zapier**.\n- Ideal if you use **Siri to quickly add reminders** and want them in Todoist.\n\n### **✅ Option 2: Two-Way Sync (Full Sync)**\n- Todoist and Apple Reminders sync **both ways**, so changes made in one reflect in the other.\n- Not natively supported by Todoist, but possible using **third-party tools like Zapier or Automate.io**.\n- Requires a paid automation tool.\n\n### **Which One is Best for You?**\n- If you mainly use Apple Reminders **for Siri/quick task input**, a **one-way sync is enough**.\n- If you want **full syncing** so that any task added, completed, or modified in one app is reflected in the other, then **two-way sync** is better.\n\n---\n\n## **2️⃣ Sharing Tasks with Farzana**\n### **✅ Option 1: Share a Todoist Project**\n- Create a **Parent Project (e.g., \"Household & Family\")**.\n- Add **Sub-Projects** under it (e.g., \"Shopping List,\" \"Chores,\" \"Appointments\").\n- Share **only the Parent Project**, and Farzana will have access to all sub-projects.\n\n### **✅ Option 2: One-Way Sync to Apple Reminders, Then Share with Farzana**\n- If you set up a **one-way sync** from Todoist to Apple Reminders, you can then **share the Apple Reminders list with Farzana**.\n- This is useful if Farzana **prefers Apple Reminders** over Todoist.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps:**\n1. **Do you prefer the One-Way Sync (Todoist → Apple Reminders) or Full Two-Way Sync?**  \n2. **Would you like me to set up the Parent Project and Sub-Projects in Todoist for you?**  \n3. **Would you prefer to just share a specific list via Apple Reminders instead?**  \n\nLet me know what works best for you! 😊"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"2dcb1b48-2f8c-4258-9de7-667f552a0d21","request_id":"9139188f4e9922f3-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2dcb1b48-2f8c-4258-9de7-667f552a0d21","children":["268bc514-dd9b-4e50-99de-7ff0bc1d480e"]},"268bc514-dd9b-4e50-99de-7ff0bc1d480e":{"id":"268bc514-dd9b-4e50-99de-7ff0bc1d480e","message":{"id":"268bc514-dd9b-4e50-99de-7ff0bc1d480e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739830208.822745,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes for the next steps it would be one and two it would be a one way sink between todoist to Apple reminders and then sharing that Apple reminders list with Farzana"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"91391b0979b122f3-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"44eb7a20-11f7-432d-9770-3dadfecaa2d6","children":["4680a441-1b55-4745-9e24-3dcdd14e41f4"]},"4680a441-1b55-4745-9e24-3dcdd14e41f4":{"id":"4680a441-1b55-4745-9e24-3dcdd14e41f4","message":{"id":"4680a441-1b55-4745-9e24-3dcdd14e41f4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739830264.654386,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Great! We'll set up a **one-way sync from Todoist to Apple Reminders** and create a **Parent Project with Sub-Projects in Todoist** for better organization. Then, you can **share the Apple Reminders list with Farzana**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up One-Way Sync (Todoist → Apple Reminders)**  \nThis setup will **automatically push tasks from a Todoist project to Apple Reminders**, allowing you to share that list with Farzana.\n\n#### **Option 1: Using Apple Shortcuts (Free & Built-In)**\nApple Shortcuts can automate this, but it requires **manual triggering**.\n\n1. Open the **Shortcuts** app on your iPhone.\n2. Tap **\"+\"** → Select **\"Create Personal Automation.\"**\n3. Choose **\"Time of Day\"** → Set how often it should run.\n4. Tap **\"Add Action\"** → Search for **\"Get Todoist Tasks.\"**\n5. Select **your shared Todoist project**.\n6. Tap **\"+\"** → Search for **\"Add to Reminders.\"**\n7. Save and run the automation.\n\n**Pros:** Free, no third-party apps needed.  \n**Cons:** Doesn’t sync in real-time; you must run it manually or schedule it.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 2: Using Zapier (Real-Time Automation)**\nZapier allows you to **automatically sync new tasks** from Todoist to Apple Reminders.\n\n1. Sign up at **[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)** (Free for 5 automations).\n2. Click **\"Create a Zap\"**.\n3. Choose **Todoist** as the **Trigger App**.\n4. Select **\"New Task in Project\"** as the trigger.\n5. Connect your Todoist account.\n6. Choose your **shared project**.\n7. Select **Apple Reminders** as the **Action App**.\n8. Set it to **create a reminder when a new Todoist task is added**.\n9. Test and activate the Zap.\n\n**Pros:** Automates the process, works in real-time.  \n**Cons:** Free plan has limits, requires Zapier setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Create Parent & Sub-Projects in Todoist**\nI’ll create a **Parent Project** called **“Household & Family”**, with the following **Sub-Projects** inside:\n\n1. **Shopping List** 🛒\n2. **Chores** 🏡\n3. **Appointments & Events** 📅\n4. **Bills & Finances** 💰\n5. **Errands** 🚗\n\n✅ **Farzana will be invited to the Parent Project, so she has access to all sub-projects.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Share the Apple Reminders List with Farzana**\n1. Open the **Reminders** app on your iPhone.\n2. Tap the **List** you set up for sync.\n3. Tap **\"Share List\"** → **\"Add People.\"**\n4. Select **Farzana’s contact** and send the invite.\n\nNow, **Farzana will see all synced tasks** from Todoist inside Apple Reminders.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Actions:**\n1. **I’ll create the Parent Project & Sub-Projects in Todoist now**.\n2. **Would you like help setting up the Zapier sync, or do you prefer to try Apple Shortcuts first?**  \n3. **Anything else you'd like adjusted before we finalize the setup?**\n\nLet me know, and I’ll proceed! 🚀"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"268bc514-dd9b-4e50-99de-7ff0bc1d480e","request_id":"91391b0979b122f3-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"268bc514-dd9b-4e50-99de-7ff0bc1d480e","children":["819bfd9f-5ae6-4ccf-9b51-3733968fac36"]},"819bfd9f-5ae6-4ccf-9b51-3733968fac36":{"id":"819bfd9f-5ae6-4ccf-9b51-3733968fac36","message":{"id":"819bfd9f-5ae6-4ccf-9b51-3733968fac36","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739830438.115173,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Do not use emojis I hate emojis.

Do you want to **share the entire \"Personal\" project**, or just **\"Home & Household\"**?\n2. If neither, would you prefer a **new shared parent project**?\n3. Do you want help **moving tasks between projects** if we restructure?  \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"46e27ffc-5d0b-4e37-91ff-942c774a7109","request_id":"913921d0ecc1e174-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"46e27ffc-5d0b-4e37-91ff-942c774a7109","children":["6d3bca04-b9e8-4159-be94-88f795f4e43c"]},"6d3bca04-b9e8-4159-be94-88f795f4e43c":{"id":"6d3bca04-b9e8-4159-be94-88f795f4e43c","message":{"id":"6d3bca04-b9e8-4159-be94-88f795f4e43c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739830533.403641,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Analyze my subprojects and the tasks within each subproject to see what needs to be shared"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"913922f97926e174-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ac32c21a-2a2c-4775-a312-63073196f690","children":["b92d20ca-720a-4ddf-b1ee-4a989d7cc3be"]},"b92d20ca-720a-4ddf-b1ee-4a989d7cc3be":{"id":"b92d20ca-720a-4ddf-b1ee-4a989d7cc3be","message":{"id":"b92d20ca-720a-4ddf-b1ee-4a989d7cc3be","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739830590.712872,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"json","response_format_name":null,"text":"{\"project_id\": \"2348488755\"}"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"6d3bca04-b9e8-4159-be94-88f795f4e43c","request_id":"913922f97926e174-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"api_todoist_com__jit_plugin.getTasks","channel":null},"parent":"6d3bca04-b9e8-4159-be94-88f795f4e43c","children":["a9827857-08bf-492c-8523-ac07e27eb52a"]},"a9827857-08bf-492c-8523-ac07e27eb52a":{"id":"a9827857-08bf-492c-8523-ac07e27eb52a","message":{"id":"a9827857-08bf-492c-8523-ac07e27eb52a","author":{"role":"tool","name":"api_todoist_com__jit_plugin.getTasks","metadata":{}},"create_time":1739830590.713072,"update_time":1739830541.8267875,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["[\n\t{\n\t\t\"id\": \"8789182025\",\n\t\t\"assigner_id\": null,\n\t\t\"assignee_id\": null,\n\t\t\"project_id\": \"2348488755\",\n\t\t\"section_id\": null,\n\t\t\"parent_id\": null,\n\t\t\"order\": 1,\n\t\t\"content\": \"Prepare for twin bed setup for new baby\",\n\t\t\"description\": \"1.

Click **“Create a new scenario.”**\n3. Click the big **\"+\"** button to **add a module**.\n4. Search for **\"Todoist\"** and select **\"Watch Tasks\"** (this will trigger the automation when a new task is added).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Todoist Trigger**\n1. Connect your **Todoist account**.\n2. Select **\"Watch Tasks in a Specific Project\"**.\n3. Choose the **sub-project(s) under \"Ib & Farzana\"** that you want to sync.\n4. Click **OK**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Add an Apple Reminders Module**\n1. Click the **\"+\"** button to add a new module.\n2. Search for **“Apple Reminders”** (you might need to enable Make's iOS integration).\n3. Choose **“Create a Reminder”** as the action.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Configure the Apple Reminders Action**\n1. Connect your **Apple Reminders account**.\n2. Choose which **Reminders List** you want tasks to go into.\n3. Under **“Reminder Name”**, map it to **Todoist task content**.\n4. (Optional) Add due dates, priority, and notes.\n5. Click **OK**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Activate the Scenario**\n1. Click **“Run Once”** to test.\n2. If everything works, click **“Save”** and **turn on scheduling**.\n3. Set it to **run every 5 minutes** for near real-time syncing.\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**\n- Whenever you add a **new task in Todoist under \"Ib & Farzana\"**, it will automatically **create a reminder in Apple Reminders**.\n- This allows you to **share the Reminders list with Farzana** while managing tasks in Todoist.\n- **Tasks won’t sync back from Reminders to Todoist**, keeping it a **one-way sync**.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n- Do you need help setting up Make, or are you comfortable handling it?\n- Would you like me to suggest additional optimizations for automation?\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"a5cabbe5-fa04-4ad6-a669-2d90fef25dbf","request_id":"91495e629e7013a0-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a5cabbe5-fa04-4ad6-a669-2d90fef25dbf","children":["5d93c235-e58d-40bd-92c0-ee2d8d960d18"]},"5d93c235-e58d-40bd-92c0-ee2d8d960d18":{"id":"5d93c235-e58d-40bd-92c0-ee2d8d960d18","message":{"id":"5d93c235-e58d-40bd-92c0-ee2d8d960d18","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740000811.258328,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Can I make this a two way sink with make?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"91496027bc7e13a0-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"08be016a-8115-463c-ab88-3df7526c9ecb","children":["7913a797-4aac-4b53-b9fa-6acf1a6742a2"]},"7913a797-4aac-4b53-b9fa-6acf1a6742a2":{"id":"7913a797-4aac-4b53-b9fa-6acf1a6742a2","message":{"id":"7913a797-4aac-4b53-b9fa-6acf1a6742a2","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740000836.777036,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes, you **can** create a **two-way sync between Todoist and Apple Reminders using Make**, but it requires careful setup to avoid infinite loops (tasks endlessly duplicating between Todoist and Reminders). Below is how you can **properly** implement it.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Set Up a Two-Way Sync in Make (Todoist ↔ Apple Reminders)**  \nThis setup will ensure that:\n- **New tasks in Todoist sync to Apple Reminders**.\n- **New tasks in Apple Reminders sync to Todoist**.\n- **Tasks marked complete in either app sync the status**.\n- **Avoids infinite loops** (tasks getting duplicated).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up a Todoist → Apple Reminders Sync**\n#### **1. Create a New Scenario in Make**\n1. **Log in to [Make](https://www.make.com/)** and click **\"Create a new scenario.\"**\n2. Click the big **\"+\"** button and add a **Todoist module**.\n3. Choose **\"Watch Tasks\"** and select:\n   - **Project:** Select the **\"Ib & Farzana\" sub-projects**.\n   - **Trigger:** \"New Task Created.\"\n\n#### **2. Add an Apple Reminders Module**\n1. Click the **\"+\"** button → Add **\"Create a Reminder\"**.\n2. Map **Todoist Task Name → Apple Reminder Name**.\n3. (Optional) Map **Todoist Due Date → Apple Reminder Due Date**.\n\n#### **3. Prevent Infinite Loops**\n- **Solution:** Add a **Make-specific tag in Todoist** (e.g., \"SyncedToReminders\") to tasks sent to Apple Reminders.\n- Before creating a task in Apple Reminders, check if the **tag is missing** in Todoist.\n- After the sync, **automatically add the tag** in Todoist to mark it as already synced.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up an Apple Reminders → Todoist Sync**\n#### **1. Create a Second Scenario in Make**\n1. Create another **new scenario**.\n2. Click **\"+\"** and add an **Apple Reminders module**.\n3. Choose **\"Watch Reminders\"** (Trigger when a new task is created).\n\n#### **2. Add a Todoist Module**\n1. Click **\"+\"** and add **\"Create Task in Todoist.\"**\n2. Map **Apple Reminder Name → Todoist Task Name**.\n3. Map **Apple Reminder Due Date → Todoist Due Date**.\n4. (Optional) Add a **\"SyncedFromReminders\" tag** in Todoist.\n\n#### **3. Prevent Infinite Loops**\n- Before creating a task in Todoist, **check if it already has the \"SyncedToReminders\" tag.**\n- This prevents Make from **creating the same task twice**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Sync Completed Tasks Between Todoist & Reminders**\n- **Scenario 1: When a task is completed in Todoist → Mark it complete in Apple Reminders**\n  1. Use the **\"Watch Completed Tasks\"** module in Make for Todoist.\n  2. Search for the same task in Apple Reminders.\n  3. Use the **\"Mark Reminder as Completed\"** action.\n\n- **Scenario 2: When a task is completed in Apple Reminders → Mark it complete in Todoist**\n  1. Use the **\"Watch Completed Reminders\"** module.\n  2. Find the task in Todoist.\n  3. Use the **\"Close Task in Todoist\"** action.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Setup Summary**\n| Scenario | Trigger | Action | Prevent Looping? |\n|----------|--------|--------|------------------|\n| **Todoist → Apple Reminders** | New Task in Todoist | Create Reminder in Apple Reminders | Add \"SyncedToReminders\" Tag in Todoist |\n| **Apple Reminders → Todoist** | New Reminder in Apple Reminders | Create Task in Todoist | Add \"SyncedFromReminders\" Tag in Todoist |\n| **Sync Completion (Todoist → Reminders)** | Task Completed in Todoist | Mark Reminder as Completed | Match Task Name |\n| **Sync Completion (Reminders → Todoist)** | Reminder Completed in Apple Reminders | Mark Todoist Task as Completed | Match Task Name |\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. **Do you want me to guide you through Make’s UI for setup?**\n2. **Would you like to add any custom conditions (e.g., only sync certain tasks)?**\n3. **Do you need help testing the sync to ensure no duplicate tasks?**\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","parent_id":"5d93c235-e58d-40bd-92c0-ee2d8d960d18","request_id":"91496027bc7e13a0-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5d93c235-e58d-40bd-92c0-ee2d8d960d18","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"7913a797-4aac-4b53-b9fa-6acf1a6742a2","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67b3b29e-ba08-8002-ba37-96fec9170f5c","conversation_template_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","gizmo_type":"gpt","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":["https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X733hp8Xqq87FW2","https://www.make.com/","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8876492792","https://zapier.com/","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8Hc44c4c3wjV4","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8789182025","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8874827688","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8874823990","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8VVmggrCjJJ3W","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8789174668","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HWPm35MCVFWr","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HV2RX9p69J9g","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8VWp54GjChPJw","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rVxxRqG2C2jgM","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8JPPMH5Mg7WXg","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8876493170","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8874826982","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X733m4f46j79vrf","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rW2QFW2RqMxHP","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8789184511","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8VWCR3HmjR8cX","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rW3CF2QMx3RGr","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8789135793","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HX9Fc7vx6qq5","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rW34Vw9vcvRQH","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rVxMxvvwX69gw","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X2mRMh3pX3G79WV","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HXWjvWq9JqjM","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rW27vch6FFj6M","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8884979090","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8851726032","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8VV6FXphPX97x","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8884978902","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HcJGRg22qpRW","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6X4rW2j94vgmR3Jg","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8851849240","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8789165017","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HWqcF44GFxr9","https://app.todoist.com/app/project/6XF8HW2wrX5PX8Wx","https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8874824360"],"default_model_slug":"o3-mini-high","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
