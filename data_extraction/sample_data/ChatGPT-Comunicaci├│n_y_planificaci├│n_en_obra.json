Correct? Then you proceed to buy all the material, because we already saw what we need, right? Then the material is bought. After that, we are already in the material, everything. Now, what do you want me to start? According to your list, you tell me. Demolish the bathroom. Yes? Then I demolish the bathroom. There, look, when I demolish the bathroom, I'm going to ask you, do you want me to demolish more? Do you want me to demolish less? Do you want ... no, less. Do not tell me the day you come to make the list, and see the work list, because it will be forgotten. And then we are going to look for a culprit. We are always looking for a problem. Instead of solving it, we are not solving it. Then you tell me, no, then we will break it. Look, if you are going to put a 36, not a 32, you need to do this, you need to do the other. You already think, you say, no, no, I don't want you to do that. You are going to put it like this, you are going to put it like this, then you already know, right? But we don't do it, for both of us it is very comfortable. I already went, let's go. No, we have to see. You already knew what you were going to do in this house, for example. I didn't know, we didn't talk about it on Sunday. You just asked me, you asked me, yes. And I stayed waiting. What time are we going to make a list, right? You already told me, no, I have my son's birthday. Well, the other day, or two, one day, we went to buy a car. But the other day the cabinets arrived. And everything was in a mess, the cabinets. Yes, I already had the plumbing, but I didn't have space to work. So I took out a box and put a cabinet in it. Only that I found the problem with the floor. So it wasn't the floor, it was another floor. And the measurements. And you stay in your head and say, how are we doing? I'm doing it wrong. Because if I break a cabinet, it costs money. But it's an example, it's a ... Do you understand me? It is necessary that you say, we already had all the materials, we already bought everything, it was already said that it was going to be done. The other day, or two days. We already have the material. Sergio, take it to the bathroom. Okay. I take it to 30, 32. Yes, to 32. Right there, you already know that you have to buy a tub of 30. Right? Or if we buy the material, i will open the box and measure the tub. Then I already know how far I have to go. Stupid question, or I don't know. Mirza, the tub is 30. Are you going to take the stem out more here, or is it going to be exactly in the tub? Well, you already tell me exactly, or I'm going to give it 3, or 2, or 4 inches. For me to think about how to put it. For example, look here. Here you can't do 36. Because you have a tube. Right? Look Mirza, you won't be able to do it. Maybe if we take it out more, it will be fine. No, no. Or we move the pipe. Right? Those are things you have to know. Right? So we already decided. But without taking away the number 1, which is the demolition. We just demolished it. Look Mirza, we have double the driver. Look Mirza. I broke this one down here. Or Mirza, the other one came off. The other tube. What I wanted to say is that my hand couldn't reach it. That is why the kitchen opens. To see if I could reach it. Those are things that I am telling you are happening. Not that you don't want to. If you want me to put the two pipes. In this case. I have to remove this one. Remove this one. Why? Because I have to place it. And it will get in the way. So I close the water. The water. I cut the tube. There is no water, so I put it in. But I have to fix it down here. If I put the pipe, I can fix it. Why? Because if I break it. They broke it. Its not my problem. Its not my problem. That I found. That the pipe is broken. Or they broke it. Or whatever. What I need is to fix it. So to fix it. I need to find a way to put my hands in. It takes longer. I wanted to finish that bathroom. So I could put the stem in. But we went back to the same thing. If you don´t tell me. That you made the contract. With the people. To put this in. I will put it in. Don´t tell me. That I don´t obey you. If you tell me. You put glue here. You put glue here. Automatically I know. That you are sending me. I am not doing anything. You are the one who pays me. And the only person. That is helping you is me. But. Its just understanding. Its just crossing words. If you are always hanging up. If you don´t want to give me information. What do you do? I use my criteria. I use my thinking. I will do it. But if you talk later. You at least. You have been answering for 30 minutes. But there are other questions. That you don´t even answer during the day. But okay. You are sick, you are worried. You are nervous. I understand a lot of things. I am not telling you with my finger. No, no. Because look. These three. Are accusing me. And I am only accusing you with one. And look at me, 1, 2, 3. Its not good for you. Because I end up more hurt than you. So. I only ask you once. From now on. Everything I ask you. If you don´t answer me. If you tell me something like that. I won´t do it. I won´t do it. Because I will do something else. When you answer me. I will do it. But don´t ask me. When I told you to do the bathroom. You didn´t do it. Remember Mirza. That I can´t start the bathroom. The tub over there. It was going to be the hole here. Or it was going to be in the middle. I knew it. You knew it. Do you remember that I asked you? Do you remember? We didn´t know with the hole here. Or with the hole here. Like men, like friends. Am I telling the truth? We didn´t know. How do I do the plumbing Mirza? Maybe if I did this. I would have done it. It was very easy to do it. But it didn´t matter that much. This was what worried me. Here the hole, here the hole. Here the hole. It doesn´t tell me. Right? So it is important. That you and I have the communication. If you only think that. Look, my knees hurt Mirza. All the work I have been doing. Has been on my knees. I put all the bathroom on my knees. Right? The only thing I put on my feet was. The damn doors that also make me crouch. But well.

They are expressing frustration with a lack of clear instructions and communication during the job. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n1. **Uncertainty and Decision-Making:**  \n   - The speaker needs confirmation on whether to proceed with specific actions (e.g., removing or keeping a piece of wood, adjusting structural elements).  \n   - They express frustration over waiting for decisions that delay progress.  \n\n2. **Structural Considerations:**  \n   - The discussion includes measurements (e.g., \"30 Latina,\" \"15 in the middle,\" \"82 or 86 from the shower\") and how different elements interact.  \n   - They are trying to determine how best to support a structure, possibly reinforcing wood for mounting or securing pipes.  \n\n3. **Frustration with Lack of Communication:**  \n   - They feel left to make decisions on their own because they are not receiving clear responses.  \n   - They want to avoid unnecessary extra work and ensure things are done correctly the first time.  \n\n4. **Authority and Clarity in Instructions:**  \n   - They reference \"being the boss\" but also clarify that they are trying to understand the work properly.  \n   - They believe some decisions should be left to them based on their expertise, but they still need clear direction.  \n\n### **Overall Meaning:**  \nThe speaker is asking for direct communication and decision-making to ensure the work progresses efficiently. They feel that if instructions were clearer upfront, they wouldn’t have to second-guess or redo tasks. The repeated references to measurements and placement suggest they are dealing with precise installations, likely in a bathroom renovation or similar project."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"a17e9ea6-feeb-450c-afb6-77eaa3d660c4","request_id":"91624571995e0011-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a17e9ea6-feeb-450c-afb6-77eaa3d660c4","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"26d6669e-5e5b-4828-b04a-8c70917820e6","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67ba48d6-ec9c-8002-9715-e79edfc1b0ed","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
