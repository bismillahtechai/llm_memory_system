Missteps in managing my business left me with heavy debt, but I am determined to recover by focusing on completing my current projects: Chi-Tea (Sheridan & Naperville), 28W500 Kenwood, 714 Pershing, and 6013 Perry (flip).\nI’ve pivoted my efforts toward innovation, including developing ContractorLens, a platform for streamlined marketing and lead generation tailored for contractors, alongside AI-driven solutions for small businesses. These initiatives align with my long-term vision of achieving financial freedom to spend more time with family and explore the world. Additionally, I’ve co-founded AmeriShield LLC, a roofing company, with three friends. Although operations have yet to begin, I remain committed to resolving challenges and delivering actionable solutions to ensure success.\nDriven by a blend of analytical thinking, resourcefulness, and a passion for learning, I value practical approaches that enhance productivity, support financial recovery, and empower personal growth. Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about old-school German cars, particularly BMWs and select Mercedes models, often diving into automotive repair and restoration.```","user_instructions":"The user provided the additional info about how they would like you to respond:\n```I always want ChatGPT to give thorough responses.
