We had moved out of it because I had lost my job and my wife wasn't working after we had our first son. And so, we weren't able to afford the rent, I'm sorry, we weren't able to afford the mortgage. So once we moved out, we put it up for rent for a year, and then the tenants moved out, and my idea was to turn it into an Airbnb. An Airbnb would have cash flowed a lot more, but it would have required management, and if we had hired a management company, then we wouldn't have made as much money as we did from long-term rentals. So then my idea was to incorporate this as a service, potentially into my Bismillah Technologies vision, and the idea was to automate the short-term rental management market, essentially. So everything about short-term rentals essentially can be automated to the 90th degree, and whatever can't be, whatever needs human input, that's where programming comes in and human-in-the-loop interactions to make sure that everything is running as smoothly as possible. So instead of 212 West Willow Street being a testbed, because we've rented that out now, and now we have a two-year lease in place, so it's not going to be possible for us to test that ourselves, we'll have to... It's still a viable option, I think, but maybe not something that we implement right away. I think we can first work on automating Windy City Construction as Windy City Construction 2.0, and then other vertical solutions along with that real estate in that vertical, and then we'd have to do some research and see exactly what the processes are and how we would need to implement an agentic solution for short-term rental management on top of bismillah technologies."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"9192bef45c832315-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bb5176b2-b343-4ca5-a993-54d72c4a8cf6","children":["93425869-0f6c-4c01-926d-77fa00ee9e33"]},"93425869-0f6c-4c01-926d-77fa00ee9e33":{"id":"93425869-0f6c-4c01-926d-77fa00ee9e33","message":{"id":"93425869-0f6c-4c01-926d-77fa00ee9e33","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740770171.300164,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"model_editable_context","model_set_context":"","repository":null,"repo_summary":null,"structured_context":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"c7f72d4b-6e3f-410e-973e-1a373696fb2c","request_id":"9192bef45c832315-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c7f72d4b-6e3f-410e-973e-1a373696fb2c","children":["ea182b30-482b-4eb2-90ad-7c3ff458f9a3"]},"ea182b30-482b-4eb2-90ad-7c3ff458f9a3":{"id":"ea182b30-482b-4eb2-90ad-7c3ff458f9a3","message":{"id":"ea182b30-482b-4eb2-90ad-7c3ff458f9a3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740770159.390847,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["This is a strong and structured approach. Your idea of automating short-term rental (STR) management through Bismillah Technologies is highly viable, but I agree that prioritizing Windy City Construction 2.0 makes sense. STR automation can still be developed, but it may need a phased approach.\n\n## **Short-Term Rental Automation (STR 2.0) Plan**\nEven though **212 West Willow St.** is no longer available as a testbed, the concept remains strong, and you could still develop and test STR automation in phases, either through partnerships or by acquiring a new test property later.\n\n### **Phase 1: Research & Process Mapping**\nBefore developing automation, break down the **end-to-end lifecycle** of STR management. Identify pain points and manual interventions. Here’s a rough framework:\n1. **Listing & Dynamic Pricing**  \n   - Automate listing creation across platforms (Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com).  \n   - Implement **dynamic pricing AI** that optimizes based on demand, seasonality, and local events.  \n\n2. **Guest Communication**  \n   - AI-driven pre-booking inquiry responses.  \n   - Automated check-in/check-out instructions.  \n   - Human-in-the-loop for escalations.  \n\n3. **Cleaning & Turnover Management**  \n   - Auto-scheduling cleaners based on check-out data.  \n   - Smart lock integration to grant cleaners time-restricted access.  \n   - Post-cleaning AI-generated reports for quality control.  \n\n4. **Smart Lock & Access Control**  \n   - Automated key codes issued based on check-in time.  \n   - Integration with smart home devices for security monitoring.  \n\n5. **Financial Tracking & Revenue Management**  \n   - AI-driven financial tracking for revenue, expenses, and taxes.  \n   - Auto-generated reports for accounting.  \n\n### **Phase 2: Build MVP (Minimal Viable Product)**\n- Develop an agent-based AI that can manage **guest messaging, cleaner scheduling, and pricing optimizations**.  \n- Integrate with APIs of platforms like Airbnb and Stripe for payment automation.  \n- Implement smart lock management using tools like August or Schlage Encode.  \n\n### **Phase 3: Pilot With Partner Hosts**\n- Instead of using **212 West Willow St.**, identify **small-scale STR hosts** willing to beta-test.  \n- Offer **free or discounted management** in exchange for real-world data and process refinement.  \n\n### **Phase 4: Scaling to Bismillah Technologies STR SaaS**\n- Package the automation system into a **SaaS-based platform** that small STR operators can use.  \n- Integrate features for property owners managing multiple units.  \n- Offer a **white-labeled solution** for property management companies.  \n\n## **Immediate Focus: Windy City Construction 2.0**\nSince STR automation isn't an immediate need, **Windy City Construction 2.0** should take priority. **Automating WCC** will:\n1. **Streamline project execution**, reducing errors and delays.  \n2. **Build AI automation expertise**, transferable to STR later.  \n3. **Optimize cash flow**, helping fund future Bismillah Technologies solutions.  \n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. **Document STR automation requirements**—what would a fully automated STR business look like?  \n2. **Break down Windy City Construction 2.0 automation goals**—what **manual processes** can be optimized first?  \n3. **Develop a tech roadmap**—how does STR automation fit within Bismillah Technologies' **overall automation stack**?  \n\nYour long-term vision is solid. **Start with WCC 2.0, then STR 2.0 can follow**, building on AI and automation capabilities developed along the way."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"93425869-0f6c-4c01-926d-77fa00ee9e33","request_id":"9192bef45c832315-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"93425869-0f6c-4c01-926d-77fa00ee9e33","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"ea182b30-482b-4eb2-90ad-7c3ff458f9a3","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67c20b6e-ac74-8002-ab3e-e44f70c9b1e1","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
