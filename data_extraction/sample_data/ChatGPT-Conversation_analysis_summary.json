Okay.  so, let me  I've gone to the property, maybe like four or five times in the last  10 days. And  One of the things that I kind of stood out to me, was the fact that like no framing work has started. Or, you know what, I mean? None of those joists look like they've been touched. If anything, I could be looking at this wrong, I don't know. It like 100% because I don't, I don't remember what it looked like when they were initially. Like,  For that ceiling and the living room. But I thought I saw like electrical conduit being put up, which I thought was just unfortunate because we're probably gonna have to redo that right? With all the joists work and all the plumbing, it's going to come down.  Yeah. So  So, we had put up.  We had put.  Electrical.  We had wired all of the  The recessed lights.  And if you remember there was already recessed lights in that.  In that room.  Originally.  and,  so we had rewired the lights, but  we had reused the  The holes that were existing.  so we didn't notch or create a new holes when we ran the electric in that room and the reason that I didn't start doing the framing,  is because after I spoke with the structural engineer,  I had met him on.  I met him at the property on.  Hey Mirza.  Yeah.  There's like, I can't I can't hear you at all.  Mirza.  Mirza.  Whereas I can't I can't hear you at all.  there's a  Mirza.  Mirza.  Mirza.  Hello.  Hello. Hey, I'm so sorry I think I don't know what I don't know when I cut off but I didn't. I just hear anything it sounded like you were talking from the other side of the room.  You know what? I put my phone down. I assume my head was connected. I'm so sorry, let me start over.  So just like a couple points. Okay, so like in the last like two weeks, I I visited the property a couple times and I I just didn't see progress happening. I'm not saying nobody was there coming there at all. I saw that like there was like new equipment, some days, like some of the breakers would be on some of some days, they would be off but like workwise, I didn't see much happening. So there was a conduit like I feel like that was being put up in the living room where those races are but that doesn't make sense to me because all those Joys have to come down or get repaired. So, I was hoping that that's like, just some old stuff and not new but to be kind of looks like, you know, it's new because what was there was flex pipe and stuff, right? So I just don't know how accurate my husband is on that. The other thing is, I don't know the outcome of the framing work that happened or the framing review. From the structural engineer, I want to know what his thoughts were on the joists, you know, his notes that he gave us so that we could get them.  Feather into that all into that those those plans, right? Those  And over to the Dress company. So, you know, anything framing related that was outside of what they already called out. Did he catch anything else? Or was there any other concerns? I don't know. But to me, bottom line is seems like framing is what.  The limiting factor or like preventing us from making progress, Alex reached out and I reach our team, I should say and to get an idea of where we're at with some plan with plumbing, what's going on? And he said that, you know, he's ready to get work done. You know, his guys are aging for like payment now, but he's saying that, like, whatever we need to do, to get this stuff passed, we'll do it. If you need to be, he said referring to, if you need to be to come take down the stuff so that the framing work can get done and then we come back and put it up, we could do it, but we need to know what's the plan.  So, you know, he's he's, he also the way it's being expressed right? Nobody's, nobody can blame or anything. Is just like, we feel like framing needs to happen.  And My Hope was when this happened, right? When all this stuff started, that's what you. And I had talked about where  After the last Roof Inn inspection was fail, then we kind of knew what was going on here. We would get what we needed feedback from the structural engineer. We would send that over to the new Page County people. And in the meantime, what we were going to do to leverage all that down time was actually have worked happened, but in my opinion like that hasn't happened right? For the last two weeks, like, none of that stuff has happened. That would have put us on Ace to  you know, be in a position to  reschedule early January.  Yeah.  so,  My.  plan was so I had  the electricians.  so, if you remember there was  Existing, recessed lights in that.  Living room, family, room area, whatever you want to call it.  and,  We had taken down those.  Lights and replace.  We had reused the existing wiring and the existing.  the existing holes that were there and  we just added more lights to how you guys wanted it.  Right. So  but then, after  after, after I had met with the  after I hadn't met with the inspector from the county and he told me that  you know, like the specification of what  They're going to be looking for as far as you know the length of flexible conduit and you know how they want the electrical to look. And  You know that stuff. Then we basically have to rewire  How how the electrical?  The electrical is done in.  in a lot of the places because they're  He is saying that.  We can use flexible conduit. They only want it.  To be maximum.  Six feet from.  From the box.  And so and then anyways, because we had to because we have to  Because we have to repair those ceiling joists.  We had to remove all of the electrical.  In that ceiling area. Anyways, and so  Um, I had sent my electricians, they had started to correct.  Whatever electrical was needed to be corrected in the house. So it started working in the master, bathroom to correct that they had started working in that main floor area. And they had started removing all of the electrical, and so, that's what you were seeing is like, prepping,  The removal. So then we can go ahead and do the framing changes.  but then, when I had met with the structural engineer,  I basically,  he had said that.  like he  this guy is like, very  I don't know how to explain it, like he like only wanted to focus on.  The areas that we needed him to address.  And he didn't want to look at anything else. Because yeah, pretty much because he was like, he was like looking if this is the area that the county is asking you to address then.  a, you know, I  I don't want to look at anything else because  You know, from what it looks like. There's  I don't, he doesn't know but you know there might be other issues that  I would see. And then at that point then  He was like, he was like, he's like one of those people where he's like, oh, it's my responsibility to then.  You know, make sure that they get fixed and like, you're just making it like a bigger deal in it.  Should have been so here. Yeah, yeah. So he was like,  so, he was like, he just wanted to focus on the  Area that the county wanted.  to ask if he just look at like the Joyce work and like the stuff for on that, or did he also looking into like, you know, we call it  You know, the area in the bathroom and and technically the kitchen because those are the two areas they called it out, really?  Where they're saying, it's going to be a problem for the way. It's  A pumped right against the exterior wall. Did he give us any suggestions or is he able to help us there? Or is that like really outside of his school?  Yeah, that's outside of his scope.  the area in the structure like  yeah, like yeah, he just like  like the, like,  Basically he's like okay this is what the issue is. Like I'll give you options on on how to correct it and that's that's it.  um,  and,  Yeah, so so that's pretty much what it was. And like I said before,  I already.  Knew what?  We needed to do from.  From a correction standpoint. You know we can either just you know replace the joists the ceiling joists in the section or we can sister them.  And he pretty much agreed.  Which was my understanding. And I was like, I was like, okay, well then can you just give me a verbal confirmation? So I can go ahead and get started and he was like, I would prefer that you. Wait. So I can do my calculations and, you know, then you know, you can make sure that you don't have to do any rework.  Okay, I was like, I was like, okay, fine. I don't think there's gonna be any  you know, changes but  the final weight and  and then he  was like, yeah, I'll get you.  These plans by.  I had met him.  I said I don't remember, but do you remember when 17th I want to 17. The reason why is because I was I wanted to come when when  He was there. The structural engineer guy not talking about.  The last prophet.  But I it was a day that I was visiting the office and that's I believe that's the same time you had met with that.  The structural engineer, I think you.  Know, the 18th is the last time.  You that I was in the office on Tuesday. And I believe the Tuesday is when you, when you met with that guy, it was Thursday before.  That, that the Russian inspection had occurred. Yeah, yeah, 17.  so, the 17th is when I met with him and he was like, yeah, I should have these to you by  by the end of the week.  If not.  You know, he was like, if not, then by Monday, latest.  And I was like, okay, perfect. And then  I didn't hear from him at all. I Friday and I had my brother follow up with him.  and by that time, I was just like,  I mean, honestly, I was just like I was really out of it, but  I I didn't hear from him at all for essentially.  To a week and a half.  and,  Finally, he had sent the report.  On.  Like Friday. The 27th at like 11 p.m.  And so that's when I actually got his report.  was was like,  pretty much like, you know,  and so, that was the other issue is that like  I was kind of stuck.  I couldn't do anything until  I got that.  Because I was waiting for that confirmation on what needed to be done for the framing.  So, I can afford that to you.  All for that. You also.  but so basically it's just  It pretty much says, what?  What we had?  Confirmed was that?  We can either replace the joists.  Or we can.  Sister them.  So they're reinforced.  but,  um,  There is.  there's a  there's a  there's like a diagram.  On where where Joyce are supposed to be like, how they can be.  Notched.  and,  The problem is that.  The.  The plumbing.  Drain line is a four inch drain line.  and,  I think they had.  I mean, I pretty sure that this is why they did that but they ran  all of the drain lines and all the water supply lines through.  Through the joist because there was existing holes already.  And so, instead of having to make a bunch of new holes,  they had just decided to  run it through the existing holes, but  The issue of what that is.  They didn't consult me before they did that.  And they just made that decision by themselves. And  And went ahead and did it. Um,  and so,  but I think we would have ran into this issue, anyways, because  Even if they ran it.  well, I guess it would have been a little bit easier because then all we would have needed to do is just  replace the joist instead of now having to remove the plumbing and  Rerun the plumbing. But but anyways,  so,  Now, we have to essentially remove the plumbing.  replace the joist and then,  I think the best thing and this is what I had asked him, so was  If we can.  We should run the plumbing.  Parallel.  to the joists instead of  like, through the  And then and then we can run we can Notch a hole looking. We can suck at a hole through the  like through the the rim joist, which is like the beam that's  connecting like between the two rooms.  So he was like we can do that and then we can just add more blocking to to reinforce around it.  And does your Structural Engineering this or yeah?  And and I think he had noted that in his in his notes also. And so  then if we do that then,  Because the issue is the four inch pipe.  Can't be.  Run through the joist without going against.  going against like, structural standards of how  Joists are supposed to be notched, it's too big of a hole to be made, okay? In that okay size of a choice, it is for the the amount that we have to have we can't have less or yeah, or is the amount that needs to be there for  Code.  So, pretty much all of that has to be rerun.  And that's for that's for the plumbing, going to the master bathroom upstairs. And so then now then  They'll have to remove all of the plumbing.  Up stairs. Also, in the master bathroom and  Essentially.  I had asked the structural engineer all, so I'm not the structure I'd ask the  Inspector. Yeah, from the county about how to address. I think I, I think I mentioned this to you. After I talked to the  Inspector. But I told him that, you know, I was just going to  Have had plywood to.  Create the exterior and the interior division.  And he was like he wants to see a continuous.  Drywall barrier.  Between where the exterior wall ends and then any Plumbing begins, right? Correct. Yeah.  So, they want to see you for us, or, like I said, that stuff is not gonna work like that, has to go down. Are they able to, like reuse majority of that or like, How's that gonna work?  I don't have.  I don't know, honestly.  Yeah, I don't know the answer to that.  Um,  so basically, we will have to  remove the  Remove, the double wall That's framed.  That's framed their put up drywall.  And then and then put that wall back.  Or we'll have to re-plan.  How?  How that bathroom is going to look.  like,  because,  We like they had the plumbing cumming.  Through the wall. Like if you look at if you look up, if you're looking  If you're in the master bathroom and you're looking at the exterior wall, the water supply lines are running horizontally through the wall.  Yes, they stub up in the corner and then they run. That's how they get to know but how he should be  Is.  They should just be stubbing up.  Where they need to come up for each fixture from the floor.  so,  instead of then,  It wouldn't need to even run through the wall horizontally, it all basically it would just come up from the first floor and then stub up from the first floor.  And so that would have avoid  with being on exterior wall. Yeah.  Exactly. I mean they still they still want to see that.  I would yeah, that drywall. Continuous drywall. But  Having the plumbing, when the plumbing gets rerun.  that's how it should be run and then,  Also, just having the plant Plumbing run.  Like parallel.  In the joists instead of through the joists, which is how I was supposed to be done. Anyways,  Is a?  What's solve that issue also?  That was another Point Break. He brought that up and I know that's not something that you've done. Or you did like the supplies for the kitchen kitchen sink. I think he kind of pointed that out for being like an issue as well.  In his pictures for the plumbing inspection.  So,  No, the the supplies.  If I remember correctly, the supplies for the kitchen sink.  I have to look at the picture but I think the supplies for the kitchen sink are coming up through the floor.  but there was a there was like, some, some valve  that was going to a silicon outside.  But it was an old valve like that Silk is not there anymore and so it just needs to be removed. So he was, he was they were pointing out something about  Like, the silk was not or that valve was not compliant.  But that still talk, like does it exist anymore, so it just it just needs to be removed.  Okay, that's good to know. That's good.  yeah, and then all when I had when I was talking to the  Building inspector from the county. He had pointed out things like  specifically for the kitchen area because like the drain line goes into the exterior wall.  Um, so he was like for things like that.  for things like that, that would need to be  Foamed know, that would need to be foamed behind it.  Yeah, yeah. To be sewn behind it because it needs to have like some  Like yeah, some like foam or some insulation behind it.  To have like a continuous, like insulation.  Running around it. So okay.  So he was like, SF like that.  Would need to be addressed.  So,  I have all the notes from that.  from that, I can send those to you and then,  I have the structural engineer report now. So,  I mean, the next steps essentially would be  I mean, we can send a the report.  Structural Engineering report as it is to the county.  but I think,  Thank you for the other. I mean, I don't know if they need to be part of the plans, but the other issue was that that we had discussed before, was that?  the plumbing, I mean, the building inspector was like, you know, the plans, need to reflect how  You know exactly how they'll work.  Is going to be done.  so, we had  and he's talking about the electric, or is he talking about like in general, like Windows, everything  I mean, I'm assuming he's talking about everything.  Um yeah, I'm assuming he's talking about everything.  and,  like I said, I  I,  I've dealt with.  Villages, you know, cities and I haven't had this issue before and this is why I have been  operating how I normally operate because I don't,  know, I haven't had to deal with the county before but you know, obviously they  Operate.  at the stricter standard for whatever reason and so  so, pretty much we'll have to  go through the plans and  add the windows that we added.  Make sure the  All the number of recessed lights, the recess lights, the plumbing pictures.  You know, pretty much all the work that's been done.  Yeah. The plumbing diagrams. Do they have to be like exactly? Because I think now the way that we're saying that we'll do it where they run parallel to the joists versus what they were running horizontal to like, you know, when you're standing in their bathroom that I'm sorry, I'm talking about supplies versus drains, but the drains running like, you know, parallel to the joists that kind of stuff. Yeah, so supplies are in the so if I remember correctly.  The plumbing.  Was.  um,  the plumbing specifically.  When Dan had marked up the plans? He  specifically, noted that  the plumbing plans are  for.  A code purposes and whatever work is being done. Needs to be done up to code. So  I think there's  some leeway there, because  there's no way to  there's no way to accurately represent how  You yeah. How the like you know how the lines are running through the the joists and stuff like that without having a  3D diagram essentially and that's why.  that's why you know, when you submit plans for plumbing, it's a 2d  Diagram representing like, what fixtures there are things like that, but then they say that, you know, the the work needs to be done to code and that's okay. That's, that's up to the license plumber doing the work.  and so that I don't think we need to address, okay, but it's more of  Everything else that the other building inspector is going to inspect. So just like  Lights, light locations.  Outlets fixtures.  Walls.  And windows. I mean, I think that's really pretty much it.  It really, let me ask you this. Oh,  When do you think we'll get started again with like framing work?  So,  Honestly. Yeah, if I understand correctly, that's what needs to happen, right? For everybody else to be able to do their work, like electricians to come in and do their work for for plumbers to rework their stuff like it all has to start with framing, right? Yeah. If I'm not mistaken for HVAC as well like and I'm only talking about the trunk that's going from the basement to the upstairs. I'm talking about like the the finishing level of like a little registers in the rooms. I'm just talking about like you know finishing up the majority, the big parts of the HVAC. Yeah.  um,  so,  I think what?  Needs to happen. First is  If you.  Remember in the beginning.  I had.  I told you that, you know,  I was operating.  for this project specifically under, like,  Very thin margins.  and,  I also normally don't.  Handle.  The permit process and, you know, drawing and things like that. Usually, all that stuff is done before I  you know, when I start the work and then  You know, I just take a look at the plans and we do the work.  but because of, you know, the loan and what was required from  The loan, um, you know, that was why I had, you know, accepted the responsibility for that.  but I think you can understand now the amount of effort that is involved with, you know, having to do all of that stuff, you know, I  I absolutely see that. I mean there's no question. Look, you stepped up big time, you know, when it came to like even for the requirements for the loan for all the stuff that you had to do even now like from from the Journey of like, when work started till now, all the stuff you have been having to deal with, you know, from the planning and permitting process, I do think like look, I said this to everybody like, you know, people who are criticized me about this process like mostly. If I'm talking about like, my family, I think, if this red tape didn't exist, I think your project, I think you would have been done. I think you would have been happy. I think you have completed this, but all this has been like a  unwanted and unexpected part of the process but it's there, right? Yeah, I do acknowledge.  I understand that.  Invested in the time that's going into the different level of work that we're doing now versus what we had discussed, but I need to know for a fact for a few things, okay?  I have to know like what does that mean like dollar for dollar? What does that translate to as like a cost increase? Right and I I need you to tell me, right? I need you to tell me like, as in as in like a Delta just general like what had what has that done in like, how is that increase the price overall. But also I think you kind of owe me like a new updated.  Like a master, I don't know what to call it, like the budget or like, remember how you sent me, like a thing that went wrong by room, right? The cost, you know, because if you think about it and the last couple months we've been operating.  In good faith. There's an understanding.  What it is. Yeah, man. I'm telling you yeah.  Any means to get money in my hands. So I give that money to you and to the other vendors, right? Like they HVAC guys who come like I'm doing my best.  But without knowing what I'm working with and what the totals are, it puts so much. Added stress on me, man. It like, I don't know what what it is. What my obligation to you is what my obligation to others is, and how I'm going to actually pay that back, right? It's put so much pressure, it makes it so hard for me to operate. So I need you to give me that like thing again, where like, you know room by room, what's the cost of everything with with now understanding the level of work that's happening and any of those changes and any of that stuff so, so that way, okay, we could say you and I could hold each other honest or keep each other honest. And say, this is what to do, this is what it is. Because God forbid, I don't want at the end.  For us to be on different pages, right? Like well okay, maybe I understood a change to be and I'm just speaking roughly. This is not where I am at let's say like, you know it was like the project was 134 and you're saying, okay now it's, you know, so much more but I figured, oh, you know, I didn't think these changes were major, right? So I want to be on the same page. I always said this from the beginning, I don't want this project to be in the red for you. It doesn't make sense, right? I don't want that. I came to you. I wanted to work with you because you're my friend. I wanted you to get this business. Yeah there's any margin to be had I wanted you to have that margin.  Instead of some Joe, schmoe some random right. Like I don't want that, I want to support people who are in our community. I want to support people like you so that we finish this project tomorrow. We work on something else. Some other part of the house you know I come back to you with confidence right? I don't want it to be a soured experience for both you or me, you know, if you recall there was this one point where you had showed me  Like a list of people that you worked with who still owe you money and stuff. Yeah, I had told you that. I don't want to end up on that list. Yeah, I don't, I, it means it matters to me, like, paying back to that and not being in debt and not doing business with you in that, like, you know, and that bad face way. I don't want that. So, yeah, you understand where you're coming from the cost of change, but you got to tell me like straight up like what that is so that way we know because look, man if you're spending this is a frustration that me and my wife are having if so let's say the cost for a certain room as gone up,  That means we have to take away from our budget for other finishing. Yeah, right. And we can't do that without knowing what we're working with and stuff. So I need you to get that back to me. I need you to tell me what these changes are. You know, I understand it's been more manpower more time on your part for  These plans and stuff I get it but you got to put it on paper and stuff so that way we can both agree to it and and and and we we keep moving forward. The other thing is Ibrahim  When you set deadlines, right? And just I want you to take note of this  I've always let you set it. I've never put. I told you, we kind of blew past this, but I told you that, like, end of November is when I need to start wrapping this up, and you had give me given me tentative schedule, where in around Christmas is when we were gonna end up project where  It's all things were positive. We were going to have our final inspections like that last week of November. Like that's where we were at, but clearly, we're not there. But you know, I gotta have something where, you know, you need to be able to meet these deadlines.  Yeah we have to plan for it. We have to make sure that you know the parts of the step, the parts of this project where we include all dressed the parts of the project were being include the county or any other outside process. We have to be mindful of the timing so that we're not I don't know blowing past these deadlines that were setting, you know?  Yeah, I it's having an impact for me. I'm telling you for many ways.  And if this is not on you, this is like this falls on you. But this is the part of us getting the project done on time that part is for you, right? But there are implications and parts of that. This is having on my family right on my extended family. Because right now, our living situation is very fluid, right? It's not  It's not like we're gonna get to the car, but I I'm in a situation where I'm impeding my father-in-law's plans to sell this house.  You know what I mean? And that's this is the house that I'm saying in and that's a huge thing, man, that like, damages wise, like, the cost that he's gonna incur the caring cost of his\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"1b087e90-cc6c-41d8-80c9-4e3d9990b35e","request_id":"8fd5e64e5c896372-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1b087e90-cc6c-41d8-80c9-4e3d9990b35e","children":["fb2971e0-e33c-43f3-b629-befd15df3c22"]},"fb2971e0-e33c-43f3-b629-befd15df3c22":{"id":"fb2971e0-e33c-43f3-b629-befd15df3c22","message":{"id":"fb2971e0-e33c-43f3-b629-befd15df3c22","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736105639.970387,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\nPlease remember to search the user's documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.\n"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"command":"prompt","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"30905daa-205c-4bd8-84c3-d36689a3bcee","request_id":"8fd5e64e5c896372-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"30905daa-205c-4bd8-84c3-d36689a3bcee","children":["1441c91d-aacb-46ad-8293-f15f3ea33bc3"]},"1441c91d-aacb-46ad-8293-f15f3ea33bc3":{"id":"1441c91d-aacb-46ad-8293-f15f3ea33bc3","message":{"id":"1441c91d-aacb-46ad-8293-f15f3ea33bc3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736105639.970502,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The transcript is lengthy and detailed.
