Task Details:\n**Task 19:** Switch Nest Doorbell with Willow St Ubiquiti doorbell  \n[View Task](https://app.todoist.com/app/task/8726400494)\n\n#### Step 1: Clarify\nThe task involves replacing one doorbell (Nest) with another (Ubiquiti) at a specific location (Willow St rental property). No ambiguity is present here.\n\n**Clarified Next Action:**  \nPrepare tools and materials needed to switch the doorbells, ensure compatibility, and plan for physical installation.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Categorize\n**Project:** This task falls under property maintenance or rental management tasks.  \n**Sub-project:** If you have a sub-project related to the Willow St property, this could belong there.  \n**Section:** A specific section for \"Repairs/Maintenance\" or \"Property Upkeep\" would be logical.\n\n**Reasoning:** The task relates to maintaining or improving the Willow St rental property and is a discrete, actionable task requiring physical effort and preparation.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Label\nExisting or potential labels that can apply:\n- **Maintenance**\n- **Willow St**\n- **Repairs**\n\nIf these labels do not exist, let me know if you'd like me to create them.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Prioritize\n**Priority Level:** 2 (Moderate urgency)  \n**Reasoning:** While not a critical task, it directly impacts the functionality of the Willow St rental property. If the current doorbell has issues, prioritization may increase.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Explanation of Logic\n- **Why \"Repairs/Maintenance\" Section?** The task is part of maintaining the functionality of the Willow St property.\n- **Why Labeling?** Labels will help you quickly find similar tasks across properties or maintenance issues.\n- **Why Priority 2?** While not immediately urgent, ensuring the property is well-maintained prevents long-term issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Next Steps:\n1. Assign this task to a specific project, sub-project, and section.\n2. Confirm if you‚Äôd like me to create or assign specific labels.\n3. Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to finalize these changes in Todoist and delete the task from the inbox.\n\nHow would you like to
