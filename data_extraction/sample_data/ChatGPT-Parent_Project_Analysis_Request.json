Sections:** You have two sections named \"One-Off Tasks,\" which might cause confusion. Consider consolidating them.\n- **Mixed Categories:** The project contains both financial (Personal Finance), wellness (Wellness Goals, Health & Fitness), and home-related (Home Improvements, 212 W Willow St) sections.\n- **No Clear Hierarchy:** Everything is under one broad **Personal** project without further sub-categorization.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Reorganization Using Sub-Projects**\nInstead of a single **Personal** project, you can break it into **sub-projects** for better clarity and organization.\n\n#### **New Structure with Sub-Projects**\n1. **🏠 Home & Household**\n   - **Home Improvements**\n   - **Property Management** (e.g., \"212 W Willow St\")\n   - **Maintenance & Repairs** (For ongoing home-related upkeep)\n\n2. **💰 Finances & Budgeting**\n   - **Personal Finance** (Budgeting, bill payments, investments)\n   - **Taxes & Legal** (For managing tax deadlines, legal paperwork)\n\n3. **🧑‍⚕️ Health & Wellness**\n   - **Health & Fitness**\n   - **Wellness Goals** (Long-term health objectives)\n   - **Medical & Appointments** (Tracking doctor visits, medications)\n\n4. **🛠 Miscellaneous & One-Offs**\n   - **One-Off Tasks** (Consolidate both sections)\n   - **Life Admin** (Errands, personal to-dos like renew driver’s license)\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\nWould you like me to **convert your sections into separate sub-projects** and organize tasks accordingly?
