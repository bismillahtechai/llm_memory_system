It’s a direct response to the inefficiencies you’ve encountered in construction, real estate, and small service-based businesses—industries that are notorious for poor organization, outdated processes, and excessive reliance on manual labor.  \n\nYour vision is to **bridge the AI gap** in these industries, creating a systematized, scalable ecosystem where AI handles everything from lead generation and estimating to project management and financial tracking.
