This is the first time I'm working with this\ncrew so I'm not sure if he'll trust me if I just tell him the payment is coming.\n\nI need to purchase and get the required material to Jesus today otherwise we will be pushed back on the entire\nschedule as the rest of the finishing depends on drywall being completed.  A payment can be called over the\nphone to the prodesk as you are aware.

It truly means a lot to me, especially as I\nwork to turn things around and execute this plan. Yes, I would  greatly appreciate the approval of the\nrequested payments for Sergio, Hugo, and Juan.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, I would like you to make the $3,500 deposit to the drywall crew as soon as I\nsend you the executed contract that I sent to him today. This will allow them to begin hanging drywall as\nscheduled, ensuring that we stay on track for the timeline I outlined. I’ll follow up with updates as the drywall\nwork progresses and once the remainder of the balance becomes due upon completion.\n\nAdditionally, I’m ready to order the windows and doors, which are a key part of the next phase of the project.\nThese items are currently on sale, and I need to place the order today or tomorrow to secure the discounted\nprice and most importantly ensure delivery by the end of next week.

This is the first detailed update I’ve sent in months, and I’d like\nto take this opportunity to not only provide a full breakdown of the project but also explain my situation\nand commitment moving forward.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve faced the worst financial position of my life, largely due to past mistakes and\nmismanagement in my business that I’ve been working hard to correct. I know I’m skilled at flipping\nhouses and contracting—I’ve proven that in the past—but the current situation has left me burnt out and\nmentally drained. This is mainly why it’s taken me so long to gather everything and provide this\ncomprehensive plan.\n\nThat said, I’ve learned from these mistakes and am now determined to move forward with a clear\nstrategy. I’ve finally reached a point where I have a full, actionable plan to get 6013 Perry Drive to market\nand am ready to proceed full steam ahead. My ultimate goal is to complete this project, sell the property,\nand take a short break to recharge before starting fresh with the knowledge and systems I’ve gained from\nthis experience.\n\nWhere the Project Stands\n\nhttp://www.chicagobridgeloan.com/\ntel:773-245-6265\ntel:773-415-9800\nmailto:mirzaik@gmail.com\nmailto:developersleigh@msn.com\nmailto:leigh@chicagobridgeloan.com\n\n\nDespite the delays in communication, progress has been made on the property. I’ve outlined a detailed\nplan for the remaining work, secured vendor agreements, and sourced all necessary materials for the\nnext stages. Here’s a summary of what’s ready to move forward:\n\nWindows and Doors: I have sourced windows, interior doors, and exterior doors from Menards,\nand they will be delivered within 8 days of ordering.\nTile: Tile has been sourced from Home Depot and will be delivered within 1-2 days after ordering.\nFlooring: I’ve sourced LVP flooring from a local supplier that can be delivered the next day.\nAppliances: I have sourced appliances from Home Depot that they will deliver and install.\nTimeline: I’m ready to place the orders for the windows and doors now and will be ready to order\nthe tile, flooring, and other materials by Monday.\n\nThis proactive sourcing ensures there will be no further delays due to material availability, and I am\ncommitted to keeping the project on schedule from this point forward. I am also hoping to take advantage\nof some sales and rebates that end in the next couple of days. \n\nCurrent Progress\n\nHere’s where the project stands in terms of inspections, current work, and major upcoming tasks:\n\n1. Inspections:\n\nI passed the insulation inspection on 11/20, but a re-inspection is required to confirm proper\nfire sealing of all penetrations. This was scheduled yesterday for tomorrow 11/27. After this\nthere will only be final building inspection and final plumbing. \n\n2. Drywall Installation:\n\nDrywall sheets are already staged from last year in the garage. I only need to replace the\nold drywall compound and purchase corner beads.\nContract received: November 24, 2024 (screenshot attached).\nHanging will start by: November 29, 2024 (this friday).\nHanging completed by: December 4, 2024.\nFinishing complete: December 10, 2024.\nPayment terms: $3,500 upfront, balance upon completion.\n\n3. Interior and Exterior Work:\n\nWindow installation (1st/2nd floors): December 5–11, 2024.\nInterior doors installation: December 6–9, 2024.\nFlooring installation: December 16–20, 2024.\n\n4. Final Acceptance:\n\nWalkthrough: January 13, 2025.\nCertificate of Occupancy: January 20, 2025.\nProperty listing: January 27, 2025.\n\nA comprehensive Microsoft Project schedule is attached for your reference.\n\nPayment and Reimbursement Requests\n\nTo maintain momentum, I’m requesting the following payments be sent out for completed work:\n\nSergio: Basement concrete backfilling, insulation, and fireproofing — $7,500.00\nHugo: Egress window installation — $2,250.00\nJuan: Insulation, demolition, and cleanup — $1,200.00\n\nTotal Payment Requested: $10,950.00\n\nOne of the major challenges I faced was a lack of proper accounting. Without a clear picture of my\nfinances, I struggled to stay on top of expenses and manage cash flow effectively. To address this, I\nrecently hired a full-time remote bookkeeper who has been instrumental in helping me organize and\n\n\n\naccount for all project-related costs. This process is how I identified the significant expenses I’ve incurred\nsince the beginning of the year, which I have not yet requested reimbursement for.\n\nMaterial Expenses: $12,795.07 (primarily from Home Depot).\nOther Project-Related Costs: $3,006.25 (e.g., storage, waste disposal, and a $775 payment for\nsump pump line installation).\n\nI have attached a line item detail of each and can provide any supporting information needed immediately.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nI am committed to seeing this project through to completion and have put systems in place to ensure clear\ncommunication and efficient execution moving forward. Now that I have a full plan in place and am\nprepared to order all remaining materials, there will be no further delays.\n\nYour continued support during this process means the world to me, and I appreciate your understanding\nas I work to finish this project and put myself back on solid financial footing. Please let me know if you\nhave any questions or need additional documentation.\n\nBest regards,\nMirza Khan\n\n\n","title":"Gmail - Update on 6013 Perry Drive_ Full Project Plan, Payment Requests, and Next Steps.pdf","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"29064bbd-0164-4e19-a1af-bcacc649d5cf","request_id":"90629e130a73aa43-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"29064bbd-0164-4e19-a1af-bcacc649d5cf","children":["911ac293-4852-4020-8f86-04a00e9b72db"]},"911ac293-4852-4020-8f86-04a00e9b72db":{"id":"911ac293-4852-4020-8f86-04a00e9b72db","message":{"id":"911ac293-4852-4020-8f86-04a00e9b72db","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1737581139.235815,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.

Master bedroom was small, so you removed a wall to combine it with an adjacent bedroom, enlarging the master suite.\r\n\r\nBasement: Previously unfinished, now finished with an added bedroom and full bathroom (815 sq ft of permitted, livable space).\r\n\r\nFirst Floor: 1,245 sq ft (35 sq ft unusable due to stairs).\r\n\r\nSecond Floor: 1,020 sq ft (50 sq ft unusable due to stairs and overlook to the first floor).\r\n\r\nScope of Renovation: Full gut rehab. Walls were taken down between the kitchen and another room to create an open floor plan. Load-bearing walls were removed, and a beam was installed. The powder bathroom on the first floor was moved to the middle of the house for a more open floor plan. Rewired the entire house (brand new electrical) and installed all new plumbing.\r\n\r\nPermitting Issue: Initially, work was started without a permit, resulting in a stop-work order. It took about a year to get the approved permit. After obtaining the permit, you had to hire a licensed plumber to redo the plumbing work and redo some electrical work to bring it up to code, add smoke detectors, and bring insulation up to code.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status (as of January 21st):\r\n\r\nCompleted Tasks:\r\n\r\nDemolition (gutted to studs).\r\n\r\nRewired the entire house.\r\n\r\nReplumbed the entire house.\r\n\r\nFraming adjustments.\r\n\r\nPassed rough inspections.\r\n\r\nInstalled all new drywall.\r\n\r\nInstalled all new insulation.\r\n\r\nInstalled all new windows (except 3 old windows in basement).\r\n\r\nInstalled all new interior and exterior doors.\r\n\r\nPurchased engineered wood flooring (pre-finished, tongue and groove, nailed down style) – on-site.\r\n\r\nPartially Completed Tasks:\r\n\r\nBase Cabinet Installation: Base cabinets along the kitchen wall are installed. Island base cabinets should be completed today as well. You instructed your contractor to frame out where the remaining base cabinets will go so the flooring installers can work around them. You need to finalize which cabinets you need with the cabinet vendor.\r\n\r\nMeasurements for wall cabinets and other cabinetry are slightly off due to framing adjustments. You need to purchase new cabinets for the kitchen wall, wet bar area, and all vanity cabinets.\r\n\r\nPending/Upcoming Tasks:\r\n\r\nFlooring Installation: Started today (1/22/2025). Flooring is being nailed down.\r\nWall Cabinet Installation (Kitchen): Requires ordering new cabinets based on updated measurements.\r\n\r\nCabinet Installation: Wet bar area and all bathroom vanities.\r\n\r\nTile Selection and Purchase: Need to finalize tile selections, get cost estimates, and send an order to the hard money lender.\r\n\r\nCasing and Baseboard Purchase: Need to purchase.\r\n\r\nWindow Refinishing (Basement): Refinish the metal frames of 3 old windows and replace the inside windows with vinyl replacement windows.\r\n\r\nBasement Floor Leveling: Requires self-leveling underlayment because the floor is angled towards a drain. Flooring contractor will install sleepers. Need to order material for this.\r\n\r\nStair Repair: Some treads are cracked and need repair.\r\n\r\nPurchase Electrical Finishes: Lights, etc.\r\n\r\nPurchase Cabinet Hardware: Pulls, knobs.\r\n\r\nPurchase Plumbing Finishes.\r\n\r\nCountertop Selection and Purchase: For the kitchen and bathroom vanities.\r\n\r\nFinal Inspections: Plumbing and building.\r\n\r\nListing the property for sale. You want to list it by February 1st.\r\n\r\nFinancials:\r\n\r\nYou owe Sergio Sanchez approximately $4000 up to this point for this project.\r\n\r\nYou need to send an email to the hard money lender detailing all remaining costs and materials needed. You can only send one email, so it needs to be comprehensive.\r\n\r\nPriorities:\r\n\r\n\r\nPayment to Sergio Sanchez: Equally critical to ensure he continues working. This is for the doors and the cabinets that have been installed so far.\r\n\r\nFinalize Cabinet Order: Determine which cabinets are needed and get an estimate from the cabinet vendor.\r\n\r\nDetailed Email to Hard Money Lender: This email should prioritize the underlayment purchase and payment to Sergio. It should also include a comprehensive list of all remaining materials and labor costs, along with estimates.\r\n\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-CKyvY7CTtZ4d31zh6ckrW7","size":5527646,"name":"Gmail - Update on 6013 Perry Drive_ Full Project Plan, Payment Requests, and Next Steps.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","file_token_size":6891}],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"90629eb718e3aa43-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c633f058-0613-4c7a-b5f8-6ad1f36fa2ff","children":["d82a358f-bf82-4811-856a-a7e1dfba988a"]},"d82a358f-bf82-4811-856a-a7e1dfba988a":{"id":"d82a358f-bf82-4811-856a-a7e1dfba988a","message":{"id":"d82a358f-bf82-4811-856a-a7e1dfba988a","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1737581203.761267,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_browsing_display","result":"","summary":"","assets":null,"tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"command":"spinner","status":"running","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa232ed-330d-4a68-bf1f-218be73b15bd","request_id":"90629eb718e3aa43-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa232ed-330d-4a68-bf1f-218be73b15bd","children":["1b6acfb4-7935-4e28-9b80-e1511c81b1fd"]},"1b6acfb4-7935-4e28-9b80-e1511c81b1fd":{"id":"1b6acfb4-7935-4e28-9b80-e1511c81b1fd","message":{"id":"1b6acfb4-7935-4e28-9b80-e1511c81b1fd","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1737581203.761374,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-CKyvY7CTtZ4d31zh6ckrW7","domain":"Gmail - Update on 6013 Perry Drive_ Full Project Plan, Payment Requests, and Next Steps.pdf","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGmail - Update on 6013 Perry Drive: Full Project Plan, Payment Requests, and Next Steps\n\n\nMirza Khan <mirzaik@gmail.com>\n\nUpdate on 6013 Perry Drive: Full Project Plan, Payment Requests, and Next Steps\nTara Hollaway <tara@chicagobridgeloan.com> Fri, Jan 3, 2025 at 1:20 PM\nTo: Mirza Khan <mirzaik@gmail.com>, Leigh Ballen <leigh@chicagobridgeloan.com>\nCc: \"suleiman@windycity-construction.com\" <suleiman@windycity-construction.com>, \"frendylyn@windycity-\nconstruction.com\" <frendylyn@windycity-construction.com>\n\nHi Mirza,\n\nI have ini�ated the $4,250 ACH to Sergio.

This is the first detailed update I’ve sent in months, and I’d like\nto take this opportunity to not only provide a full breakdown of the project but also explain my situation\nand commitment moving forward.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve faced the worst financial position of my life, largely due to past mistakes and\nmismanagement in my business that I’ve been working hard to correct. I know I’m skilled at flipping\nhouses and contracting—I’ve proven that in the past—but the current situation has left me burnt out and\nmentally drained. This is mainly why it’s taken me so long to gather everything and provide this\ncomprehensive plan.\n\nThat said, I’ve learned from these mistakes and am now determined to move forward with a clear\nstrategy. I’ve finally reached a point where I have a full, actionable plan to get 6013 Perry Drive to market\nand am ready to proceed full steam ahead. My ultimate goal is to complete this project, sell the property,\nand take a short break to recharge before starting fresh with the knowledge and systems I’ve gained from\nthis experience.\n\nWhere the Project Stands\n\nhttp://www.chicagobridgeloan.com/\ntel:773-245-6265\ntel:773-415-9800\nmailto:mirzaik@gmail.com\nmailto:developersleigh@msn.com\nmailto:leigh@chicagobridgeloan.com\n\n\nDespite the delays in communication, progress has been made on the property. I’ve outlined a detailed\nplan for the remaining work, secured vendor agreements, and sourced all necessary materials for the\nnext stages. Here’s a summary of what’s ready to move forward:\n\nWindows and Doors: I have sourced windows, interior doors, and exterior doors from Menards,\nand they will be delivered within 8 days of ordering.\nTile: Tile has been sourced from Home Depot and will be delivered within 1-2 days after ordering.\nFlooring: I’ve sourced LVP flooring from a local supplier that can be delivered the next day.\nAppliances: I have sourced appliances from Home Depot that they will deliver and install.\nTimeline: I’m ready to place the orders for the windows and doors now and will be ready to order\nthe tile, flooring, and other materials by Monday.\n\nThis proactive sourcing ensures there will be no further delays due to material availability, and I am\ncommitted to keeping the project on schedule from this point forward. I am also hoping to take advantage\nof some sales and rebates that end in the next couple of days. \n\nCurrent Progress\n\nHere’s where the project stands in terms of inspections, current work, and major upcoming tasks:\n\n1. Inspections:\n\nI passed the insulation inspection on 11/20, but a re-inspection is required to confirm proper\nfire sealing of all penetrations. This was scheduled yesterday for tomorrow 11/27. After this\nthere will only be final building inspection and final plumbing. \n\n2. Drywall Installation:\n\nDrywall sheets are already staged from last year in the garage. I only need to replace the\nold drywall compound and purchase corner beads.\nContract received: November 24, 2024 (screenshot attached).\nHanging will start by: November 29, 2024 (this friday).\nHanging completed by: December 4, 2024.\nFinishing complete: December 10, 2024.\nPayment terms: $3,500 upfront, balance upon completion.\n\n3. Interior and Exterior Work:\n\nWindow installation (1st/2nd floors): December 5–11, 2024.\nInterior doors installation: December 6–9, 2024.\nFlooring installation: December 16–20, 2024.\n\n4. Final Acceptance:\n\nWalkthrough: January 13, 2025.\nCertificate of Occupancy: January 20, 2025.\nProperty listing: January 27, 2025.\n\nA comprehensive Microsoft Project schedule is attached for your reference.\n\nPayment and Reimbursement Requests\n\nTo maintain momentum, I’m requesting the following payments be sent out for completed work:\n\nSergio: Basement concrete backfilling, insulation, and fireproofing — $7,500.00\nHugo: Egress window installation — $2,250.00\nJuan: Insulation, demolition, and cleanup — $1,200.00\n\nTotal Payment Requested: $10,950.00\n\nOne of the major challenges I faced was a lack of proper accounting. Without a clear picture of my\nfinances, I struggled to stay on top of expenses and manage cash flow effectively. To address this, I\nrecently hired a full-time remote bookkeeper who has been instrumental in helping me organize and\n\n\n\naccount for all project-related costs. This process is how I identified the significant expenses I’ve incurred\nsince the beginning of the year, which I have not yet requested reimbursement for.\n\nMaterial Expenses: $12,795.07 (primarily from Home Depot).\nOther Project-Related Costs: $3,006.25 (e.g., storage, waste disposal, and a $775 payment for\nsump pump line installation).\n\nI have attached a line item detail of each and can provide any supporting information needed immediately.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nI am committed to seeing this project through to completion and have put systems in place to ensure clear\ncommunication and efficient execution moving forward. Now that I have a full plan in place and am\nprepared to order all remaining materials, there will be no further delays.\n\nYour continued support during this process means the world to me, and I appreciate your understanding\nas I work to finish this project and put myself back on solid financial footing. Please let me know if you\nhave any questions or need additional documentation.\n\nBest regards,\nMirza Khan\n\n\n","title":"Gmail - Update on 6013 Perry Drive_ Full Project Plan, Payment Requests, and Next Steps.pdf","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"d82a358f-bf82-4811-856a-a7e1dfba988a","request_id":"90629eb718e3aa43-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d82a358f-bf82-4811-856a-a7e1dfba988a","children":["e804677f-4c0c-4ad3-b8ea-dbbc8ae1a15d"]},"e804677f-4c0c-4ad3-b8ea-dbbc8ae1a15d":{"id":"e804677f-4c0c-4ad3-b8ea-dbbc8ae1a15d","message":{"id":"e804677f-4c0c-4ad3-b8ea-dbbc8ae1a15d","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1737581203.761447,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded.
