It's been installed. Um, baseboard, uh, sorry, casing needs to be installed. It needs to be painted. And we need a handle and lock set. We need all of the switches and outlets installed. We need floor vents.\r\n\r\n**01:00 - 01:37:** We need L-beads on the inside of the window. We need drywall corners on the top, left, and right, and white oak window sill on the bottom of all the windows. We need outlets installed again. This is the wet bar area. So, it's going to have a sink base over here. And then cabinets going over here.\r\n\r\n**01:38 - 02:06:** We're going to need to build out um with plywood or something else to bring this area from here to the toe kick of the cabinet, the base cabinets. We're going to need to get uh registered vent for here.\r\n\r\n**02:07 - 02:36:** This is a return cover actually. We're going to need to get the all the ducts cleaned and the furnace cleaned and tuned up. More outlets and switches. This is the baseboard, uh, sorry, this is the um pantry that needs to be um installed. And then, actually, we're going to be installing, it's going to be a built-in uh pantry with a built-in microwave. So, we need to pull power from here for that microwave. And it's going to go right there.\r\n\r\n**02:37 - 03:16:** We need a lock set for here.\r\n\r\n**03:17 - 03:40:** I need to call the dumpster company to get all of the uh, to get the dumpster swapped out. And I need to call the garage door guy to get this garage door tuned up.\r\n\r\n**03:41 - 04:19:** Angel needs to install lights on the outside of the right and left of the garage. And then remove the light that's in the center of the garage on the outside. Uh, he needs to install outlets that are existing. Just reinstall them over here. And then fix this conduit here. So, we can plaster around this. This is the door going to the back.\r\n\r\n**04:20 - 04:59:** We need a lock set for it. And then brick moulder casing for it. This is the door that is going into the house. It needs to be fireproofed with fireproof foam. And then probably PVC casing and brick mould.\r\n\r\n**05:00 - 05:57:** So, here because the soffit is bigger than we had originally planned, I need to buy a new cabinet that goes here that's going to be 27 inches wide and 30 inches long. And then, we're going to install one more cabinet here. And then there's going to be open shelving, white oak open shelving, white oak and then cabinet over here. So, this space and this space should be the same.\r\n\r\n**05:58 - 06:57:** And then there's going to be not crown molding, but like straight blocking. And same thing over there. It's going to be like built up. It's not going to be crown. Over here, we're going to need to move that gas line back over there. And then, actually, I'm going to need to move these cabinets more back because I need to install a downdraft vent.\r\n\r\n**06:58 - 07:26:** So, these back set of cabinets are going to have to be moved back. I need to order the appliances from Home Depot. Um,\r\n\r\n**07:27 - 08:07:** This fridge needs to be thrown out. These need to be returned. For all the pocket doors, I need to figure out how to case them properly. Ideally, I want them to be drywall returned. So, I think I need to take this out. Take these out. So, then we can finish them with drywall. I think that's what needs to be done.\r\n\r\n**08:08 - 08:59:** Okay, here, I'm going to need a wall-mounted sink or a pedestal. Probably wall-mounted. And then a vanity light. And then a motor and a light here for the exhaust. That actually needs to get moved over because there's no spacer. So, there needs to be a spacer installed over there.\r\n\r\n**09:00 - 09:59:** And then, same thing when this cabinet's installed over here. There needs to be a spacer installed over here. So, between the cabinet that goes up against the soffit and then the cabinet that goes under the soffit, there needs to be a spacer. Same thing, all the windows will be drywall return on the right top or on the left top, right, and then the bottom will be a white oak sill. We'll probably use a 1x6 white oak. And then, we'll notch it out here. So, it'll like slide in like this. I need to buy uh cabinet pulls for all the doors and drawers.\r\n\r\n**10:00 - 10:59:** We need to make sure all of these corners on the cabinet are finished nicely. Over here, I need to install a bifold door and built-in shelving. And then, there's going to be a light here. Same thing for all the windows like we discussed. All the outlets and switches. Over here, uh, I want to install a linear fireplace, either electric or gas. Um, and then build this out a little bit, maybe on the right and left.\r\n\r\n**11:00 - 11:59:** And have some arches on the right and left, some bookshelves inside those arches. And then, it'll be like maybe uh white oak vertical paneling, like slats. All of the doors need to be painted. We need locks, handle sets for all the doors, interior. Um, like this detail needs to be fixed here. This was because we put a wider door than we originally planned in this area, but you know, we made it work. Uh, all of the hinges for the interior doors, I'm going to change to like brush gold or brass. Probably brush gold.\r\n\r\n**12:00 - 12:59:** All the doors are going to be the handles are going to be black. The cabinet pulls for the kitchen are all going to be brush gold. And all the lighting should be brush gold and black. And then the floor is this engineered white oak color. So, for here for the stairs, we need to flush this out. So, it's level. So, the framing needs to be flushed out. And then, there needs to be a 1x that goes on the top, the front, and the top, which is going to be white oak. And then, got a modern looking squared off post. And then, a handrail that goes into the wall. And then probably squared balusters or cable balusters.\r\n\r\n**13:00 - 13:59:** Right here, we'll probably just cut this off here. And then, these are all going to be finished in white oak treads. And then, white risers. Or maybe just white oak treads, white oak risers. And then, same thing, um, you know, squared off handrail or squared off handrails. And either square balusters or cable.\r\n\r\n**14:00 - 14:59:** All the flooring is finished up here. Over here, we're going to install um a I have the the slab door. We're going to We need to frame this out. Drywall it. And then, it's going to be a 30 at least a 36-inch opening. So, we can fit the washer and dryer in. And it's going to be a sliding door with a nice black rail on top.\r\n\r\n**15:00 - 15:59:** Here is the bedrooms. We need the central light fixture in each bedroom. Possibly an accent wall in each bedroom. Um, and then, these are going to be bifold doors for this closet. And then, we need just simple closet shelves with uh with a bar for hangers. Same thing here. Simple closet shelves. All the closets are going to be motion sensor lights. Bifold central light fixture or fan.\r\n\r\n**16:00 - 16:59:** All the windows will be finished on the right, left, and top. And then, white oak sill. I need to buy a a piece of flat white PVC for each window. Um, that will cover the mul for the double windows on the inside and outside. Again, all of the outlets need to be installed. The floor covers, or the vents need to be installed. The baseboard and casing need to be installed after the flooring is done. Switches need to be installed. Casing, doors need to be painted. Interior door knobs or levers. And then, we're going to change out these hinges for brush gold.\r\n\r\n**17:00 - 17:59:** Here's the hall bath. Um, We are going to Either keep this window and install one of the windows that we have downstairs, or completely remove the window. And then, install a niche in the middle here. And then, we need to remove all of the den shield because it's not siliconed between the joints. So, it needs to be removed, but it's glued to the studs in the back. So, when it gets removed, it might rip. So, I think we're going to need all new den shield.\r\n\r\n**18:00 - 18:59:** Um, Yeah. So, that's like one, two, three, four, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 pieces of den shield. And then, we need to float this pan. We're going to install a uh shower drain. And then, there's going to be a curb here.\r\n\r\n**19:00 - 19:59:** We're going to use the same tile on the floor in the shower and outside the shower. And then, the wall tile for the shower is going to be one wall tile. And the wall tile will go up until the edge over here. And then, there's going to be metal trim here. And then, same thing, it'll go up to the edge over there. And then, there'll be metal trim. And I need to get a uh cartridge with a trim set. And then, a shower head.\r\n\r\n**20:00 - 20:59:** And then, here, we need to purchase the vanity cabinets. GFCI outlets. Um, and then, I can use these boxes for the mirrors if I want to put LED mirrors. And then, install separate like hanging lights on top. There's another central light fixture here. And then, need a motor and a light trim kit for that fan exhaust also.\r\n\r\n**21:00 - 21:59:** And then, a cover for this vent. And then, those switches need to be installed. All of the valves need to be installed over there. For all the valves. Obviously, toilet. Reiling needs to be installed over here. Same thing for all the windows like we've been saying. And then, a chandelier over here for the staircase. A central light fixture or fan for the master.\r\n\r\n**22:00 - 22:59:** A switched light for the master closet with some built-in shelving. Again, figure out how to finish these.\r\n\r\n**23:00 - 23:59:** GFCI outlets. And then, those boxes can be used for uh for the mirrors, LED mirrors. And then, we can just install new boxes in the ceiling for hanging lights. But then, we also have a central light fixture here. And then, we need to finish this window. Same as before, left, right, top, drywall return, and then bottom, white oak window sill.\r\n\r\n**24:00 - 24:59:** Over here, it's going to be corner shower, 48 inches, 48 inches. We're going to put a niche over here. Uh, preformed niche. We need to float the pan to the middle. It's going to be a curb here. Square. We need to take out this den shield. And then, put it back because the joints were not siliconed. So, all of the joints need to be siliconed um when they're installed.\r\n\r\n**25:00 - 25:59:** But the they were glued when they were installed to the studs. So, they might rip. Um, So, if so then we might need new den shield. Which is just one, two, three, four, five, six pieces. And then, the lights are already installed over here. Those are going to be um You know, sitting right over the uh shower. Uh, those might be a little off actually. Yeah, if you look at the shower where the shower is, those might have to be moved over to center it with the shower. And then, we need a trim kit for that exhaust. Install the toilet.\r\n\r\n**26:00 - 26:59:** Um, all of the plumbing is going to be done by the plumber who's on the contract. He's going to do all the finish plumbing. So, he's going to install the toilet. Uh, install the valves, water stop valves. Um, install all of, you know, these valves, connect all these things, install the faucets, all that stuff. But, I need you to do everything else. So, install the cabinets. Install the tile. Uh, tile backer, grout.\r\n\r\n**27:00 - 27:59:** All that stuff. There's two lights here, but I think one is a smoke alarm, fire alarm, and one is a light. Because this one is a smoke alarm, fire alarm. There's one in each room. They're hardwired. And they're on a separate circuit. And then, we need to install a trim kit for that, which is right there. For the dryer duct.\r\n\r\n**28:00 - 28:59:** The framing for these stairs need to be fixed. You can see they're cracked right here. So, the framing for these stairs need to be fixed. I mean, this is how they had it on this side. I would say we just install like, you know, the same thing, one, two, by four for support on this side. And then, you know, fix whatever riser and tread needs to be fixed. And then, I need blocking over here so I can install 5/8 drywall to the back of the stairs. And then, this box needs to be flushed with whatever drywall is installed here.\r\n\r\n**29:00 - 29:59:** So, that's where the stairs is broken. So, for the basement, same thing, uh, we need to install a box for the handrail. And then, handrail going into the wall. And then, either squared balusters or cables. Uh, all of this painting for the black painting needs to be touched up. That's for Warren. He needs to paint touch up all the black ceiling.\r\n\r\n**30:00 - 30:59:** All the black needs to be touched up. We need to either purchase um the holders for these flat lights. Like, they're like thin plates that get screwed in. And then, paint them black or just cut them out of um uh plywood. Might be easier to cut them out of plywood since we might already have the plywood here. And then, paint them black and install them. That way, the lights can get installed into those. Uh, all of these windows, the metal window, they're going to come out. We're going to install these vinyl window sliders. It's like a retrofit.\r\n\r\n**31:00 - 31:59:** So, that'll just go into this frame. And then, we will trim out this. I would say that we would just trim this out with drywall. But, we have to install the windows first. And then, this needs to get replaced also because this window is cracked. Just put water in it. And then, we have to clean all of the window wells. Uh, they're going to start installing these floors probably by the end of the week. But, before they do that, they need to install sleepers out of 1x6s to level out the floor.\r\n\r\n**32:00 - 32:59:** Yeah, I'll just do drywall return here. And then, we got to clean out the window well. Oh, I need to install that. Install the filter. We need bifold doors over here too in the basement bedroom. This thermostat needs to be installed upstairs in the kitchen area. This door The The door needs to The door knob area needs to come up here. So, this needs to come up here.\r\n\r\n**33:00 - 33:59:** So, it's like So, it's on the same level as where the other door knobs are. This is the basement bathroom. So, we need to install the vanity cabinets. Either there, you know, LED light, LED mirrors. I think here, we would need um\r\n\r\n**34:00 - 34:59:** vanity mirrors, vanity lights because we don't have a central light fixture. We just have this exhaust box, which we need a new one. Um, because I don't know where the trim kit is for it. But, the other bathroom's like we have a central light fixture, so we can put LED mirrors. And then, install a bright central light fixture or a nice-looking central light fixture. And then, here, I need to remove and replace this tub. So, that means this drywall has to get cut out. When we put it back, we'll just put den shield. And then, install the tile over here. We'll install tile.\r\n\r\n**35:00 - 35:59:** And the plumber is going to do all the plumbing finishes. For the outside, um, we need to install J-trim around all of these doors and windows.\r\n\r\n**36:00 - 36:59:** Probably remove this um aluminum on the bottom and install a PVC piece. Uh, we need to install lights on the right and left. This light needs to be removed. It's not connected to power anymore, so it just needs to be removed. And then, um the siding needs to be replaced so it covers the hole. Same thing, all of the windows and doors need the uh vinyl repair around\r\n\r\n**37:00 - 37:59:**  vinyl repair around\r\n\r\n**38:00 - 38:59:** That piece needs to be repaired. The whole house needs to be power washed. We could probably replace all the gutters, black gutters. Replace this light or sorry, remove this light. Like I was saying earlier. And then, install a new light over here and over there. I need to put this AC pad and condenser back that went over here in this area, but we need to backfill all of this first. That's going to happen this week.\r\n\r\n**39:00 - 39:59:** This needs to be removed. That needs to be fixed. I will probably remove this light LED strip that's there and install a new one for a nice effect. Remove this cable. Put a cover over it. Put a cover over it. Remove this. Put a cover over it.\r\n\r\n**40:00 - 40:59:** I need to tell the flooring guys to fix this subfloor. And then, install the engineered wood floor over here in the sunroom area if we have any extra. And over here, probably remove this siding because we need to fix this hole. But, the siding is not available, so I'll just say I don't know, remove this siding and put something else on top of it. I don't know what the solution would be for here. Or just Or just put something else on top of it.\r\n\r\n**41:00 - 41:59:** And then, this like needs to be cleaned and sealed. Ideally, if I can find a window or a door that would fit here that's black, that would be the best case scenario. Same thing here. The vinyl needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n**42:00 - 42:59:** Over here also, the vinyl needs to be fixed. All of these papers will need to be removed. All these papers will need to be removed. And this vinyl needs to be fixed. There's another one.\r\n\r\n**43:00 - 43:59:** There's another one.\r\n\r\n**44:00 - 44:59:** Oh, we need to install insulation in the attic. Blowing insulation in the attic. The guys are coming this week for the uh um installing new sod. He's going to cut out all of this sod, grass, install new sod, top soil, and mulch. I need\r\n\r\n**45:00 - 45:59:** Ideally, I'd need this power washed. And then, maybe coat painted in an epoxy. And then, this ideally should be leveled out, but it's too cold, so maybe we'll just pour a new sidewalk. I don't know.
