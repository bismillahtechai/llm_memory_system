Missteps in managing my business left me with heavy debt, but I am determined to recover by focusing on completing my current projects: Chi-Tea (Sheridan & Naperville), 28W500 Kenwood, 714 Pershing, and 6013 Perry (flip).\nI’ve pivoted my efforts toward innovation, including developing ContractorLens, a platform for streamlined marketing and lead generation tailored for contractors, alongside AI-driven solutions for small businesses. These initiatives align with my long-term vision of achieving financial freedom to spend more time with family and explore the world. Additionally, I’ve co-founded AmeriShield LLC, a roofing company, with three friends. Although operations have yet to begin, I remain committed to resolving challenges and delivering actionable solutions to ensure success.\nDriven by a blend of analytical thinking, resourcefulness, and a passion for learning, I value practical approaches that enhance productivity, support financial recovery, and empower personal growth. Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about old-school German cars, particularly BMWs and select Mercedes models, often diving into automotive repair and restoration.```","user_instructions":"The user provided the additional info about how they would like you to respond:\n```I always want ChatGPT to give thorough responses.

Take a full-page screenshot:\n   - On Windows: Use `Windows + Shift + S` or a tool like Snipping Tool.\n   - On Mac: Use `Cmd + Shift + 4`.\n3. Save each screenshot as an image file and crop/adjust as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Use an Adobe Account**\nIf the document creator allows, you can:\n1. Log into your **Adobe account**.\n2. See if the document provides an option to download or share it in PDF or other formats.\n   - Some InDesign shares include a download toggle that may need to be enabled by the creator.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Third-Party Extensions/Tools**\n- Use browser extensions like **GoFullPage** (Chrome/Edge) to capture the entire document viewable in the browser.\n- These tools can save scrollable areas as a single image or PDF.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Request Access from the Creator**\nIf none of the above work:\n1. Contact the person who shared the document.\n2.
