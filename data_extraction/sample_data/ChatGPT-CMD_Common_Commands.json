Third-Party Tools**\nFor a more comprehensive scan of your network, consider third-party tools like **Nmap**, but this requires separate installation.

Use `nbtstat` to Find by Name**\nThe **nbtstat** command can display network devices by name. Run:\n\n```cmd\nnbtstat -a Khan-PC\n```\n\n- This will query the device **Khan-PC** for its IP address and MAC address.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Search the ARP Table**\nThe **arp -a** command lists devices your computer has communicated with. Look for the IP address of **Khan-PC**:\n\n```cmd\narp -a\n```\n\n- If **Khan-PC** is active, it should appear in the list of devices, and you can identify it by its MAC address (if known).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Use `net view` to List Devices**\nThe **net view** command shows all shared resources and systems on your local network:\n\n```cmd\nnet view\n```\n\n- Check the list for **Khan-PC**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Use `nslookup` to Resolve Name**\nIf you know the domain or DNS settings of your network, try resolving the hostname:\n\n```cmd\nnslookup Khan-PC\n```\n\n- This will attempt to resolve **Khan-PC** to its IP address.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Use Network Discovery in the GUI**\nIf Command Prompt doesn't locate the device:\n1. Open **File Explorer**.\n2. Navigate to **Network** on the left panel.\n3. Look for **Khan-PC** in the discovered devices.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips If You Can't Find Khan-PC**\n- Ensure **Khan-PC** is powered on and connected to the same network.\n- Verify it has the correct network name.\n- Check if it has a firewall blocking incoming connections.\n- Use a third-party network scanning tool like **Advanced IP Scanner** or **Nmap** to scan the network comprehensively.
