Growing up with undiagnosed ADHD, I’ve had to navigate the effects of depression, anxiety, and burnout—challenges that continue to shape my journey. Missteps in managing my business left me with heavy debt, but I am determined to recover by focusing on completing my current projects: Chi-Tea (Sheridan & Naperville), 28W500 Kenwood, 714 Pershing, and 6013 Perry (flip).\nI’ve pivoted my efforts toward innovation, including developing ContractorLens, a platform for streamlined marketing and lead generation tailored for contractors, alongside AI-driven solutions for small businesses. These initiatives align with my long-term vision of achieving financial freedom to spend more time with family and explore the world. Additionally, I’ve co-founded AmeriShield LLC, a roofing company, with three friends. Although operations have yet to begin, I remain committed to resolving challenges and delivering actionable solutions to ensure success.\nDriven by a blend of analytical thinking, resourcefulness, and a passion for learning, I value practical approaches that enhance productivity, support financial recovery, and empower personal growth. Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about old-school German cars, particularly BMWs and select Mercedes models, often diving into automotive repair and restoration.```","user_instructions":"The user provided the additional info about how they would like you to respond:\n```I always want ChatGPT to give thorough responses.
