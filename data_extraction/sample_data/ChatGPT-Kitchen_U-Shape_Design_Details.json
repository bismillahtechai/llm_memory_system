I’m excited to start this new kitchen project with you. I’ve attached a screenshot of the existing space for reference. Below is an overview of the desired layout and the measurements we’ll be working with.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Project Overview\r\n- **Current Setup:** The kitchen is currently set up in an **L-shape** (see attached screenshot).  \r\n- **Goal:** Transform the kitchen into a **U-shaped** layout by adding additional base and wall cabinets on the third wall (Wall C).  \r\n- **Reference Photo:** See the attached screenshot, with labels for Walls A, B, and C.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Wall-by-Wall Details & Measurements\r\n\r\n#### **Wall A (Future Fridge Wall)**\r\n- **Length:** 105 1/4″  \r\n  - (We chose the slightly smaller measurement; any extra space can be taken up with filler.)  \r\n- **Full Wall Height (to Ceiling):** 108 7/16″  \r\n- **Refrigerator:**  \r\n  - Positioned at the far-left corner of Wall A.  \r\n  - Dimensions: 32.75″ (W) x 31″ (D) x 69.75″ (H).  \r\n  - 3/4″ refrigerator panels on each side for a built-in look.  \r\n- **Cabinet Above Refrigerator:** 33″ wide x 12″ high x 24″ deep (W331224) to tie into the upper cabinets on Wall B.\r\n\r\n#### **Wall B (Stove Wall)**\r\n- **Total Length:** 127 11/32″  \r\n- **Height to Bottom of Soffit:** 84 23/32″  \r\n- **Full Ceiling Height:** 108 7/16″  \r\n- **Stove Centerlines:**  \r\n  - **From Left Wall:** 70 3/4″  \r\n  - **From Right Wall:** 56 19/32″  \r\n  (Sum to the total wall length; any additional space can be filled.)\r\n\r\n#### **Wall C (Sink Wall – New Addition for U-Shape)**\r\n- **Total Length:** 100 23/32″  \r\n- **Sink Centerlines:**  \r\n  - **From Left Wall:** 67 7/16″  \r\n  - **From Right Wall:** 33 9/32″  \r\n  (Again, these measurements add up correctly.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Design & Functionality Notes\r\n1. **Layout Change to U-Shape:** The existing L-shape will gain an additional run of cabinets along Wall C, creating a U.  \r\n2. **Lazy Susans:** We’d like a lazy susan where Wall A meets Wall C and another where Wall B meets Wall C.  \r\n3. **Upper Cabinets & Soffit:** The upper cabinets on Wall B must fit below the existing soffit (84 23/32″ to the bottom). The over-fridge cabinet on Wall A should align with these uppers.  \r\n4. **Filler Strips:** We’ve undersized a few measurements so that any extra field space can be managed with standard filler pieces.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Next Steps\r\nPlease use these revised dimensions and the attached photo to draft a cabinet layout with the new U-shape in mind. If you have any questions—especially about corner cabinet sizing or filler placement—feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your help and look forward to seeing your proposed design. Let me know what additional information or clarifications you might need.\r\n\r\n**Best regards,**  \r\n[Your Name]  \r\n[Your Contact Information]"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"906a4a497885ce07-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d3a12943-f1b9-4b78-b8a3-5640e133804b","children":["a6cb9dde-5982-41a6-b201-44b9fb75f2fa"]},"a6cb9dde-5982-41a6-b201-44b9fb75f2fa":{"id":"a6cb9dde-5982-41a6-b201-44b9fb75f2fa","message":{"id":"a6cb9dde-5982-41a6-b201-44b9fb75f2fa","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737661635.228358,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"model_editable_context","model_set_context":"","repository":null,"repo_summary":null,"structured_context":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa26ca7-a222-4481-935d-27089769e353","request_id":"906a4a497885ce07-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa26ca7-a222-4481-935d-27089769e353","children":["a1056074-6a0d-431c-af9e-cba5cb0acadf"]},"a1056074-6a0d-431c-af9e-cba5cb0acadf":{"id":"a1056074-6a0d-431c-af9e-cba5cb0acadf","message":{"id":"a1056074-6a0d-431c-af9e-cba5cb0acadf","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1737661635.228521,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Subject:** New Kitchen Project – Measurements & Design Details  \n\nHi [Vendor Name],  \n\nI hope this email finds you well!
