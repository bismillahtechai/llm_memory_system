However, you can achieve something very similar using a tool like **AutoHotkey** (AHK). AutoHotkey is free, lightweight, and lets you remap keys or create custom hotkeys and scripts.\n\nBelow is an outline of how to set this up:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Install AutoHotkey\n\n1. Go to the official [AutoHotkey website](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and download the latest version.  \n2. Run the installer. Choose “Express Installation” (or “Custom” if you prefer).\n\nOnce installed, you’ll be able to create or edit **.ahk** script files.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Create a new AutoHotkey script\n\n1. Right-click on your Desktop or in a folder.\n2. Select **New** → **AutoHotkey Script**.\n3. Name the file something like `Dictation.ahk`.\n\nRight-click the script and choose **Edit Script** to open it in a text editor (Notepad or your preferred editor).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Write the AutoHotkey code\n\nBelow is an example script that detects a long press on the **F10** key (you can choose a different key if you prefer). If you hold **F10** down for more than 500ms (0.5 seconds), the script will send the **Windows+H** keystroke.\n\n```ahk\n;------------------------------------------------\n; AutoHotkey script to trigger Windows+H (dictation)\n; when F10 is long-pressed\n;------------------------------------------------\n\nF10::\n    KeyWait, F10, T0.5  ; Wait up to 0.5 seconds for the key to be released\n    if ErrorLevel\n    {\n        ; If ErrorLevel is 1, it means 0.5 seconds passed \n        ; and the key is still held down.\n        Send, #h        ; # is the Windows key in AutoHotkey\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ; Key was released quickly. You can optionally \n        ; do something else here, or leave it blank.\n    }\nreturn\n```\n\n### How this script works\n\n- When you press **F10**, AutoHotkey waits up to 0.5 seconds for you to release it.\n- If after 0.5 seconds the key is still held, AutoHotkey interprets that as a “long press” and sends **Windows+H**.\n- If you release the key within that 0.5 second window, it does nothing by default. You can customize this behavior if you want a different short press action.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Test and refine\n\n1. Save your script.\n2. Double-click the `.ahk` file to run it (you’ll see the AHK icon in the system tray).\n3. Long-press **F10** (or whichever key you chose). If all went well, the **Windows+H** dictation bar should appear.\n4. Adjust the “T0.5” part of the script if you want a shorter/longer press duration (e.g., T0.3 for 300ms, T0.7 for 700ms, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Make the script run at startup (optional)\n\nIf you find this helpful and want it always available:\n\n1. Press **Windows+R**, type `shell:startup`, and press **Enter**.\n2. Copy your `.ahk` script into the Startup folder.\n3. Windows will automatically launch it each time you sign in.\n\n---\n\n### Notes & Tips\n\n- You can change `F10` to another key or key combination if you like, but be mindful not to override keys you need regularly.\n- If you prefer a single-key press (without the long-press logic), you can simply do something like:\n\n  ```ahk\n  F10::Send, #h\n  ```\n  That means every time you tap **F10**, Windows+H is triggered immediately.\n- Be aware that some special keys (e.g., media keys) might be tricky to remap. Generally, standard function keys, letters, or other normal keys are simpler to work with.\n- Also note that Windows Security and certain full-screen applications (like games) might interfere with AHK in some contexts.\n\n---\n\n**In summary**:  \nWindows natively requires **Win+H** to start dictation, but by using AutoHotkey, you can set up a custom trigger—like long pressing one key—to emulate that shortcut. This workaround gives you the flexibility that Windows doesn’t provide out of the box."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"0d591e3f-5fa2-4843-8857-8727ba35f3b2","request_id":"9000f66e9cb7e81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0d591e3f-5fa2-4843-8857-8727ba35f3b2","children":["aaa2aa37-3ef8-455c-8fb3-5037a9b21957"]},"aaa2aa37-3ef8-455c-8fb3-5037a9b21957":{"id":"aaa2aa37-3ef8-455c-8fb3-5037a9b21957","message":{"id":"aaa2aa37-3ef8-455c-8fb3-5037a9b21957","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736557302.79963,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What if I want to use the plus button on the numpad"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9000fa222bc7e81a-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"df429412-57a9-467a-b00c-0988161d9f87","children":["d6ef183f-231c-41d2-b572-fa3669917338"]},"d6ef183f-231c-41d2-b572-fa3669917338":{"id":"d6ef183f-231c-41d2-b572-fa3669917338","message":{"id":"d6ef183f-231c-41d2-b572-fa3669917338","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736557310.623531,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Mapping out NumpadAdd**\n\nI’m thinking through an AHK script for the NumpadAdd key.

Look at the following documentation\n\nA hotkey is a key or key combination that triggers an action. For example, Win+E normally launches File Explorer, and F1 often activates an app-specific help function. AutoHotkey has the power to define hotkeys that can be used anywhere or only within specific apps, performing any action that you are able to express with code.\r\n\r\nThe most common way to define a hotkey is to write the hotkey name followed by double-colon, then the action:\r\n#n::Run \"notepad\"\r\nS↓\r\n\r\n\r\nThis example defines a hotkey that runs Notepad whenever you press Win+N. To learn how to try it out, refer to How to Run Example Code.\r\n\r\nFor more about running programs, see How to Run Programs.\r\n\r\nIf multiple lines are required, use braces to mark the start and end of the hotkey's action. This is called a block.\r\n#n::\r\n{\r\n    if WinExist(\"ahk_class Notepad\")\r\n        WinActivate  ; Activate the window found above\r\n    else\r\n        Run \"notepad\"  ; Open a new Notepad window\r\n}\r\nS↓\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening brace can also be written on the same line as the hotkey, after ::.\r\n\r\nThe block following a double-colon hotkey is implicitly the body of a function, but that is only important when you define your own variables. For now, just know that blocks are used to group multiple lines as a single action or statement (see Control Flow if you want to know more about this).\r\n\r\nBasic Hotkeys\r\n\r\nFor most hotkeys, the hotkey name consists of optional modifier symbols immediately followed by a single letter or symbol, or a key name. Try making the following changes to the example above:\r\n•Remove # to make the hotkey activate whenever you press N on its own. Keep in mind that if something goes wrong, you can always exit the script.\r\n•Replace # with ^ for Ctrl, ! for Alt or + for Shift, or try combinations.\r\n•Replace # with <^ to make it activate only when the left Ctrl key is pressed, or >^ for the right Ctrl key, or both to require both keys.\r\n•Replace n with any other letter or symbol (except :).\r\n•Replace n with any name from the key list.\r\n\r\nNote: The last character before :: is never interpreted as a modifier symbol.\r\n\r\nWith this form of hotkey, only the final key in the combination can be written literally as a single character or have its name spelled out in full. For example:\r\n•#:: would create a hotkey activated by the hash key, or whatever combination is associated with that symbol (on the US layout, it's Shift+3).\r\n•##:: would create a hotkey like the above, but which activates only if you are also holding the Windows key.\r\n•LWin:: would create a hotkey activated by pressing down the left Windows key without any other modifier keys.\r\n\r\nThe most common modifiers are Ctrl (^), Alt (!), Shift (+) and Win (#).\r\n\r\nThe symbols < and > can be prefixed to any one of the above four modifiers to specify the left or right variant of that key. The modifier combination <^>! corresponds to the AltGr key (if present on your keyboard layout), since the operating system implements it as a combination of LCtrl and RAlt.\r\n\r\nThe other modifiers are:\r\n•* (wildcard) allows the hotkey to fire even if you are holding modifier keys that the hotkey doesn't include symbols for.\r\n•~ (no-suppress) prevents the hotkey from blocking the key's native function.\r\n•$ (use hook) prevents unintentional loops when sending keys, and in some instances makes the hotkey more reliable.\r\n\r\nTo make a hotkey fire only when you release the key instead of when you press it, use the UP suffix.\r\n\r\nRelated: Hotkey Modifier Symbols, List of Keys\r\n\r\nContext-sensitive Hotkeys\r\n\r\nThe #HotIf directive can be used to specify a condition that must be met for the hotkey to activate, such as:\r\n•If a window of a specific app is active when you press the hotkey.\r\n•If CapsLock is on when you press the hotkey.\r\n•Any other condition you are able to detect with code.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n#HotIf WinActive(\"ahk_class Notepad\")\r\n^a::MsgBox \"You pressed Ctrl-A while Notepad is active. Pressing Ctrl-A in any other window will pass the Ctrl-A keystroke to that window.\"\r\n#c::MsgBox \"You pressed Win-C while Notepad is active.\"\r\n\r\n#HotIf\r\n#c::MsgBox \"You pressed Win-C while any window except Notepad is active.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou define the condition by writing an expression which is evaluated whenever you press the hotkey. If the expression evaluates to true, the hotkey's action is executed.\r\n\r\nThe same hotkey can be used multiple times by specifying a different condition for each occurrence of the hotkey, or each hotkey variant. When you press the hotkey, the program executes the first hotkey variant whose condition is met, or the one without a condition (such as the final #c:: in the example above).\r\n\r\nIf the hotkey's condition isn't met and there is no unconditional variant of the hotkey, the keypress is passed on to the active window as though the hotkey wasn't defined in the first place. For instance, if Notepad isn't active while running the example above, Ctrl+A will perform its normal function (probably Select All).\r\n\r\nTry making the following changes to the example:\r\n•Replace WinActive with WinExist so that the hotkeys activate if Notepad is running, even if Notepad doesn't have the focus.\r\n•Replace the condition with GetKeyState(\"CapsLock\", \"T\") so that the hotkeys only activate while CapsLock is on.\r\n•Add another ^a or #c hotkey for some other window, such as your web browser or editor. Note that we use ahk_class so that the example will work on non-English systems, but you can remove it and use the window's title if you wish.\r\n\r\nCorrectly identifying which window you want the hotkey to affect sometimes requires using criteria other than the window title. To learn more, see How to Manage Windows.\r\n\r\nRelated: #HotIf, Expressions, WinActive\r\n\r\nCustom Combinations\r\n\r\nA custom combination is a hotkey that combines two keys which aren't normally meant to be used in combination. For example, Numpad0 & Numpad1:: defines a hotkey which activates when you hold Numpad0 and press Numpad1.\r\n\r\nWhen you use a key as a prefix in a custom combination, AutoHotkey assumes that you don't want the normal function of the key to activate, since that would interfere with its use as a modifier key. There are two ways to restore the key's normal function:\r\n1.Use another hotkey such as Numpad0::Send \"{Numpad0}\" to replicate the key's original function. By default, the hotkey will only activate when you release Numpad0, and only if you didn't press Numpad0 and Numpad1 in combination.\r\n2.Prefix the combination with tilde (~), as in ~Numpad0 & Numpad1::. This prevents AutoHotkey from suppressing the normal function of Numpad0, unless you have also defined Numpad0::, in which case the tilde allows the latter hotkey to activate immediately instead of when you release Numpad0.\r\n\r\nNote: Custom combinations only support combinations of exactly two keys/mouse buttons, and cannot be combined with other modifiers, such as !#^+ for Alt, Win, Ctrl and Shift.\r\n\r\nAlthough AutoHotkey does not directly support custom combinations of more than two keys, a similar end result can be achieved by using #HotIf. If you run the example below, pressing Ctrl+CapsLock+Space or Ctrl+Space+CapsLock should show a message:\r\n#HotIf GetKeyState(\"Ctrl\")\r\nSpace & CapsLock::\r\nCapsLock & Space::MsgBox \"Success!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to press Ctrl first in this example.

In AutoHotkey v2, hotkeys and commands have slightly different syntax than in v1. Below is a **v2-compatible** example showing how to long-press the **numpad plus** key to send **Win+H** (start dictation). This should help avoid any syntax errors.\n\n---\n\n## AutoHotkey v2 Example\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n\n; Long-press Numpad \"+\" to trigger Windows+H\nNumpadAdd::\n{\n    ; Wait up to 0.5s for the key to be released.\n    ; If it times out (key is still held), ErrorLevel becomes 1.\n    KeyWait \"NumpadAdd\", \"T0.5\"\n    if (ErrorLevel)\n    {\n        ; Key was held down for 0.5s, so send Win+H.\n        Send \"#h\"\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        ; Key was released quickly; do nothing or add another action here.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How It Works\n1. `#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0`: Ensures your script runs under AutoHotkey v2.  \n2. `NumpadAdd:: { ... }`: Defines a hotkey block for the numpad’s plus key.  \n3. `KeyWait \"NumpadAdd\", \"T0.5\"`: Waits up to 0.5 seconds for the key to be released.  \n   - If the key remains pressed at 0.5s, **ErrorLevel** is set to `1` → “long press.”  \n   - If released earlier, **ErrorLevel** is `0` → “short press.”  \n4. Inside the `if (ErrorLevel)` block, we send **Win+H** if it’s a long press. You can tweak the 0.5 seconds (`T0.5`) to any duration you prefer.\n\n---\n\n## If You Are Using AutoHotkey v1\nIf you happen to be on **AutoHotkey v1**, the script needs a different syntax:\n\n```ahk\n#NoEnv\nSendMode Input\n\nNumpadAdd::\nKeyWait, NumpadAdd, T0.5\nif ErrorLevel\n{\n    Send, #h\n}\nreturn\n```\n\n- Notice the commas after commands (like `KeyWait, NumpadAdd, T0.5`) and the `return` at the end. That’s standard for v1.\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Troubleshooting\n1. **Syntax Version**: Confirm you’re on AutoHotkey v2 if you want to use the `Run \"program\"` style, braces for hotkey blocks, etc. If you installed the newer version directly from the [AutoHotkey website](https://www.autohotkey.com/), it defaults to v2 now (unless you explicitly chose v1).  \n2. **Test in Notepad**: After saving, double-click your `.ahk` script to run it. Open Notepad or somewhere you can test dictation and **long-press** the numpad plus key. If dictation starts, it’s working.  \n3. **Startup**: To make this script run when you sign in, place it in your Startup folder:  \n   - Press **Win+R**  \n   - Type `shell:startup` and **Enter**  \n   - Copy your `.ahk` file into the folder that appears.  \n\nWith this setup, you’ll have a working long-press hotkey on your numpad plus key to activate Windows dictation without the syntax errors!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"5327a531-e65b-4b0f-8378-0e7281e25b89","request_id":"900101661f1de81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5327a531-e65b-4b0f-8378-0e7281e25b89","children":["aaa25e10-83ed-460d-9ead-fde74d00888e"]},"aaa25e10-83ed-460d-9ead-fde74d00888e":{"id":"aaa25e10-83ed-460d-9ead-fde74d00888e","message":{"id":"aaa25e10-83ed-460d-9ead-fde74d00888e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736557724.872359,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I got another error when trying to run:\n\nWarning: This local variable appears to never be assigned a value.\r\n\r\nSpecifically: ErrorLevel\r\n\r\n\t005: {\r\n\t008: KeyWait(\"NumpadAdd\", \"T0.5\")\r\n▶\t009: If (ErrorLevel)\r\n\t010: {\r\n\t012: Send(\"#h\")\r\n\r\nFor more details, read the documentation for #Warn.\n\nHere's the documentation:\n\n#Warn\r\n\r\nEnables or disables warnings for specific conditions which may indicate an error, such as a typo or missing \"global\" declaration.\r\n#Warn [WarningType, WarningMode]\r\nS\r\n\r\n\r\nParameters\r\nWarningType\r\nType: String\r\n\r\nIf omitted, it defaults to All.

Specifically, `KeyWait` returns `\"Timeout\"` if the specified time limit is reached, or an empty string (`\"\"`) if the key is released in time.\n\nBelow is an updated **v2** script demonstrating how to long-press **NumpadAdd** (the plus key on your numpad) to send **Win+H** without triggering a warning.\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n\n; Long-press Numpad \"+\" to trigger Win+H\nNumpadAdd:: {\n    ; KeyWait returns \"Timeout\" if key is still held when T0.5 is reached.\n    result := KeyWait(\"NumpadAdd\", \"T0.5\")\n    if (result = \"Timeout\") {\n        ; Key was held for at least 0.5s → send Win+H\n        Send \"#h\"\n    }\n    ; Else: do nothing for a short press\n}\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **`KeyWait(\"NumpadAdd\", \"T0.5\")`:** Tells AutoHotkey to wait up to 0.5 seconds for NumpadAdd to be released.  \n   - If the key is released before 0.5s, `KeyWait` returns an empty string (`\"\"`).  \n   - If 0.5s passes and the key is still held down, `KeyWait` returns `\"Timeout\"`.  \n2. **`if (result = \"Timeout\")`:** Checks if the function returned `\"Timeout\"`. If so, we know it was a “long press,” and we send **Win+H**.  \n3. You can adjust `T0.5` to another duration (e.g., `T0.3` or `T1`), depending on how long you want your “long press” to be.  \n4. **No `ErrorLevel`**: In v2, you must check the function’s return value directly. `ErrorLevel` is a legacy concept from v1 and will show a warning/error in v2 scripts.  \n\nWith this change, you should no longer get the “local variable never assigned” warning, and the long-press should work as intended!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"38f72d6f-98ff-409c-a57e-6dd80d5be5ff","request_id":"900104701959e81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"38f72d6f-98ff-409c-a57e-6dd80d5be5ff","children":["aaa2c486-0b1b-4fd0-b71a-eb26529b13c4"]},"aaa2c486-0b1b-4fd0-b71a-eb26529b13c4":{"id":"aaa2c486-0b1b-4fd0-b71a-eb26529b13c4","message":{"id":"aaa2c486-0b1b-4fd0-b71a-eb26529b13c4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736557911.000636,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I don't know that didn't work let's change it to the F2 key"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"900108fb7f9de81a-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cddde4fe-635e-4fd0-874b-453eb460e719","children":["9ed00e08-0571-43b0-8ccb-4fe8abb8a064"]},"9ed00e08-0571-43b0-8ccb-4fe8abb8a064":{"id":"9ed00e08-0571-43b0-8ccb-4fe8abb8a064","message":{"id":"9ed00e08-0571-43b0-8ccb-4fe8abb8a064","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736557916.840338,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Thought about using F2 for dictation for a couple of seconds","initial_text":"Thinking","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa2c486-0b1b-4fd0-b71a-eb26529b13c4","request_id":"900108fb7f9de81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2c486-0b1b-4fd0-b71a-eb26529b13c4","children":["89450e17-4ae8-4c1d-a16e-43d2d5595841"]},"89450e17-4ae8-4c1d-a16e-43d2d5595841":{"id":"89450e17-4ae8-4c1d-a16e-43d2d5595841","message":{"id":"89450e17-4ae8-4c1d-a16e-43d2d5595841","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736557916.840533,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is a **v2** script example for using **F2** instead of **NumpadAdd**.

More direct methods tend to work only in particular types of app.\r\n\r\nThere are broadly two parts to learning how to send keys:\r\n1.How to write the code so that the program knows which keys you want to send.\r\n2.How to use the available modes and options to get the right end result.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that sending a key does not perfectly replicate the act of physically pressing the key, even if you slow it down to human speeds. But before we go into that, we'll cover some basics.\r\n\r\nTrying the examples\r\n\r\nIf you run an example like SendText \"Hi!\", the text will be immediately sent to the active (focused) window, which might be less than useful depending on how you ran the example. It's usually better to define a hotkey, run the example to load it up, and press the hotkey when you want to test its effect. Some of the examples below will use numbered hotkeys like ^1:: (Ctrl and a number, so you can try multiple examples at once if there are no duplicates), but you can change that to whatever suits you.\r\n\r\nTo learn how to customize the hotkeys or create your own, see How to Write Hotkeys.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure how to try out the examples, see How to Run Example Code.\r\n\r\nHow to write the code\r\n\r\nWhen sending keys, you generally want to either send a key or key combination for its effect (like Ctrl+C to copy to the clipboard), or type some text. Typing text is simpler, so we'll start there: just call the SendText function, passing it the exact text you want to send.\r\n^1::SendText \"To Whom It May Concern\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnically SendText actually sends Unicode character packets and not keystrokes, and that makes it much more reliable for characters that are normally typed with a key-combination like Shift+2 or AltGr+a.\r\n\r\nRules of quoted strings\r\n\r\nSendText sends the text verbatim, but keep in mind the rules of the language. For instance, literal text must be enclosed in quote marks (double \" or single '), and the quote marks themselves aren't \"seen\" by the SendText function. To send a literal quote mark, you can enclose it in the opposite type of quote mark. For example:\r\n^2::SendText 'Quote marks are also known as \"quotes\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, use an escape sequence. Inside a quoted string, `\" translates to a literal \" and `' translates to a literal '. For example:\r\n^3::{\r\n    SendText \"Double quote (`\")\"\r\n    SendText 'Single quote (`')'\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also alternate the quote marks:\r\n^4::SendText 'Double (\") and' . \" single (') quote\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two strings are joined together (concatenated) before being passed to the SendText function. The dot (.) can be omitted, but that makes it harder to see where one ends and the other begins.\r\n\r\nAs you've seen above, the escape character ` (known by backquote, backtick, grave accent and other names) has special meaning, so if you want to send that character literally (or send the corresponding key), you need to double it up, as in Send \"``\". Other common escape sequences include `n for linefeed (Enter) and `t for tab. See Escape Sequences for more.\r\n\r\nSending keys and key combinations\r\n\r\nSendText is best for sending text verbatim, but it can't send keys that don't produce text, like Left or Home. Send, SendInput, SendPlay, SendEvent and ControlSend can send both text and key combinations, or keys which don't produce text. To do all of this, they add special meaning to the following symbols: ^!+#{}\r\n\r\nThe first four symbols correspond to the standard modifier keys, Ctrl (^), Alt (!), Shift (+) and Win (#). They can be used in combination, but otherwise affect only the next key.\r\n\r\nTo send a key by name, or to send any one of the above symbols literally, enclose it in braces. For example:\r\n•^+{Left} produces Ctrl+Shift+Left\r\n•^{+}{Left} produces Ctrl++ followed by Left\r\n•^+Left produces Ctrl+Shift+L followed literally by the letters eft\r\n\r\nWhen you press Ctrl+Shift+\", the following example sends two quote marks and then moves the insertion point to the left, ready to type inside the quote marks:\r\n ^+\"::Send '\"\"{Left}'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor any single character other than ^!+#{}, Send translates it to the corresponding key combination and presses and releases that combination. For example, Send \"aB\" presses and releases A and then presses and releases Shift+B. Similarly, any key name enclosed in braces is pressed and released by default. For example, Send \"{Ctrl}a\" would press and release Ctrl, then press and release A; probably not what you want.\r\n\r\nTo only press (hold down) or release a key, enclose the key name in braces, followed by a space and then the word \"down\" or \"up\". The following example causes Ctrl+CapsLock to act as a toggle for Shift:\r\n*^CapsLock::{\r\n    if GetKeyState(\"Shift\")\r\n        Send \"{Shift up}\"\r\n    else\r\n        Send \"{Shift down}\"\r\n}\r\nS↓\r\n\r\n\r\nHotkeys vs. Send\r\n\r\nWarning: Hotkeys and Send have some differences that you should be aware of.\r\n\r\nAlthough hotkeys also use the symbols ^!+# and the same key names, there are several important differences:\r\n•Other hotkey modifier symbols are not supported by Send. For example, >^a:: corresponds to RCtrl+A, but to send that combination, you need to spell out the key name in full, as in Send \"{RCtrl down}a{RCtrl up}\".\r\n•Key names are never enclosed in braces within hotkeys, but must always be enclosed in braces for Send (if longer than one character).\r\n•Send is case-sensitive. For example, Send \"^A\" sends the combination of Ctrl with upper-case \"a\", so Ctrl+Shift+A. By contrast, ^a:: and ^A:: are equivalent.\r\n\r\nThis is because Send serves multiple purposes, whereas hotkeys are optimized for key combinations.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, hotstrings are exclusively for detecting text entry, so the symbols ^!+#{} have no special meaning within the hotstring trigger text. However, a hotstring's replacement text uses the same syntax as Send (except when the T option is used). Whenever you type \"{\" with the following hotstring active, it sends \"}\" and then Left to move the insertion point back between the braces:\r\n:*?B0:{::{}}{Left}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind mode\r\n\r\nNormally, Send assumes that any modifier keys you are physically holding down should not be combined with the keys you are asking it to send. For instance, if you are holding Ctrl and you call Send \"Hi\", Send will automatically release Ctrl before sending \"Hi\" and press it back down afterward.\r\n\r\nSometimes what you want is to send some keys in combination with other modifiers that were previously pressed or sent. To do this, you can use the {Blind} prefix. While running the following example, try focusing a non-empty text editor or input field and pressing 1 or 2 while holding Ctrl or Ctrl+Shift:\r\n*^1::Send \"{Blind}{Home}\"\r\n*^2::Send \"{Blind}{End}\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more about {Blind}, see Blind mode.\r\n\r\nOthers\r\n\r\nSend supports a few other special constructs, such as:\r\n•{U+00B5} to send a Unicode character by its ordinal value (character code).\r\n•{ASC 0181} to send an Alt+Numpad sequence.\r\n•{Click Options} to click or move the mouse.\r\n\r\nFor a full list, see Key names.\r\n\r\nModes and options\r\n\r\nSending a key does not perfectly replicate the act of physically pressing the key. The operating system provides several different ways to send keys, with different caveats for each. Sometimes to get the result you want, you will need to not only try different methods but also tweak the timing.\r\n\r\nThe main methods are SendInput, SendEvent and SendPlay. SendInput is generally the most reliable, so by default, Send is synonymous with SendInput. SendMode can be used to make Send synonymous with SendEvent or SendPlay instead. The documentation describes other pros and cons of SendInput and SendPlay at length, but I would suggest just trying SendEvent or SendPlay when you have issues with SendInput.\r\n\r\nWarning: SendPlay doesn't tend to work on modern systems unless you run with UI access.\r\n\r\nAnother option worth trying is ControlSend. This doesn't use an official method of sending keystrokes, but instead sends messages directly to the window that you specify. The main advantage is that the window usually doesn't need to be active to receive these messages. But since it bypasses the normal processing of keyboard input by the system, sometimes it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nTiming and delays\r\n\r\nSometimes you can get away with sending a flood of keystrokes faster than humanly possible, and sometimes you can't. There are generally two situations where you might need a delay:\r\n•A keypress is supposed to trigger some change within the target app (such as showing a new control or window), and sending another keypress before that happens will have the wrong effect.\r\n•The app can't keep up with a rapid stream of keystrokes, and you need to slow them all down.\r\n\r\nFor the first case, you can simply call Send, then Sleep, then Send, and so on.\r\n\r\nSetKeyDelay exists for the second case. This function can set a delay to be performed between each keystroke, and the duration of the keystroke (i.e. the delay between pressing and releasing the key).\r\n^1::{\r\n    SetKeyDelay 75, 25  ; 75ms between keys, 25ms between down/up.\r\n    SendEvent \"You should see the keys{bs 4}text appear gradually.\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning: SendInput does not support key delays, nor does Send by default.\r\n\r\nIn order to make SetKeyDelay effective, you must generally either use SendMode \"Event\" or call SendEvent, SendPlay or ControlSend instead of Send or SendText.\r\n\r\nSending a lot of text\r\n\r\nOne way to send multiple lines of text is to use a continuation section:\r\nSendText \"\r\n(\r\n    Leading indentation is stripped out,\r\n    based on the first line.\r\n    Line breaks are kept\r\n    unless you use the \"Join\" option.\r\n)\"\r\nS↓\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally quite fast, SendText still has to send each character one at a time, while Send generally needs to send at least twice as many messages (key-down and key-up). This adds up to a noticeable delay when sending a large amount of text. It can also become unreliable, as a longer delay means higher risk of conflict with input by the user, the keyboard focus shifting, or other conditions changing.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is faster and more reliable to instead place the text on the clipboard and paste it. For example:\r\n^1::{\r\n    old_clip := ClipboardAll()  ; Save all clipboard content\r\n    A_Clipboard := \"\r\n    (Join`s\r\n        This text is placed on the clipboard,\r\n        and will be pasted below by sending Ctrl+V.\r\n    )\"\r\n    Send \"^v\"\r\n    Sleep 500  ; Wait a bit for Ctrl+V to be processed\r\n    A_Clipboard := old_clip  ; Restore previous clipboard content\r\n}\r\n\r"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"90010e95e92ae81a-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"89450e17-4ae8-4c1d-a16e-43d2d5595841","children":["c1c43609-252b-4a19-9518-479bc4d30c2f"]},"c1c43609-252b-4a19-9518-479bc4d30c2f":{"id":"c1c43609-252b-4a19-9518-479bc4d30c2f","message":{"id":"c1c43609-252b-4a19-9518-479bc4d30c2f","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736558171.942291,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Investigating keyboard action**\n\nUser wants to activate Win+H with a long-pressed F2 in AHK.

Let’s walk through it step-by-step:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Key Detection Test\n\n**First**, confirm AutoHotkey actually *sees* the F2 key:\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n#Persistent\n\nF2:: {\n    MsgBox \"F2 was pressed.\"\n}\n```\n\n1. Save this as `TestF2.ahk`.\n2. Double-click to run it. (You’ll see an H icon in your taskbar’s system tray if it’s running.)\n3. Press **F2**.  \n   - If a message box appears, AHK is detecting F2.  \n   - If not, it might mean:\n     - You need to press **Fn+F2** (on some laptops).\n     - Another program overrides F2 at a lower level.\n     - Your BIOS/firmware is configured so that “F2” is not sending a normal F2 scan code.  \n   - Also ensure the script is running with the correct privileges (sometimes running as Administrator helps).\n\nIf **this** test doesn’t pop up a message box, AutoHotkey isn’t seeing F2 at all. In that case, try a different key (e.g., `F3`, `F4`, or a letter) to see if it’s recognized.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Check Key History\n\nIf the basic key detection fails, use AHK’s built-in **Key History**:\n\n1. Right-click the green “H” AutoHotkey icon in your system tray.\n2. Choose **Open** → **View** → **Key history and script info**.\n3. Press **F5** (refresh).\n4. Press **F2** on your keyboard.\n5. Press **F5** again to refresh the key log.\n\nIf you do **not** see an entry for **F2**:\n- Your system might be treating F2 as a special function key (e.g. brightness, volume, etc.).\n- You might need to press the **Fn** key to get the actual “F2” scancode.\n- Check your BIOS settings to ensure function keys are set to behave as standard F-keys rather than media keys.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Test a Simple Send of Win+H\n\nIf the basic detection works (you see “F2 was pressed.”), but you still can’t get dictation to pop up with a long press, let’s try a *very simple* short-press test:\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n#Persistent\n\n; Just pressing F2 sends Win+H immediately (short press).\nF2::Send \"#h\"\n```\n\n1. Run this script.  \n2. Tap **F2**.  \n   - If Windows dictation pops up, we know sending **Win+H** works on your system.  \n   - If it doesn’t, check that your Windows Settings → “Voice typing” or “Dictation” is enabled, and that **Win+H** normally works if you press it on your keyboard manually.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Implement a Long-Press Check\n\nIf short-press `F2::Send \"#h\"` works, but you specifically want **long press** functionality, here’s a script that also shows **beep** feedback to confirm it’s running:\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n#Persistent\n\nF2:: {\n    ; Beep so we know F2 was detected.\n    SoundBeep 1500, 100\n    result := KeyWait(\"F2\", \"T0.5\")  ; Wait up to 0.5s\n\n    if (result = \"Timeout\") {\n        ; If key was still down at 0.5s, beep again\n        SoundBeep 1000, 100\n        SendEvent \"#h\"  ; Try sending via SendEvent\n    } else {\n        ; If you release F2 quickly, beep with a different tone\n        SoundBeep 800, 100\n        ; (Do nothing else by default)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`SoundBeep 1500, 100`**: Immediately beep, so you know the script captured your **F2** press.  \n2. **`result := KeyWait(\"F2\", \"T0.5\")`**: Wait up to 0.5 seconds to see if F2 is still held.  \n   - Returns **`\"Timeout\"`** if the key is still pressed after 0.5 seconds (which means “long press”).  \n   - Returns **`\"\"`** if you let go of F2 early (short press).  \n3. **`SendEvent \"#h\"`**: We use `SendEvent` (instead of just `Send`) in case `SendInput` is blocked by certain apps or by the system.  \n\nTry holding **F2** for a bit over half a second. You’ll hear a first beep (when you initially press down F2), then if you hold it the full 0.5 seconds, you’ll hear a second beep at the moment your script tries to do **Win+H**.\n\n- If you **never** hear the second beep, it likely means you released F2 too soon or the script never recognized the long press.  \n- If you hear the beep but dictation doesn’t show up, Windows might be ignoring the programmatic Win+H signal.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Additional Considerations\n\n1. **Run as Admin**: Some system keystrokes like Win+… might be blocked by permissions. Right-click your script → “Run as administrator.”  \n2. **Fn Key**: If you’re on a laptop, function keys (F1–F12) may require pressing **Fn** or changing a BIOS setting to act as normal F-keys.  \n3. **Windows 10 vs. Windows 11**: On Windows 11, you must enable “Voice Typing” (Win+H) in Settings. On Windows 10, the dictation feature might be called something else or require additional microphone permissions. Make sure it works when you physically press Win+H on your keyboard.  \n4. **Is Another Script Overriding F2?** If you have multiple AHK scripts that define F2, it could cause a conflict.  \n5. **Try a Different Key**: If F2 is giving trouble, test with something like `F3`, or even a letter (e.g. `z`). Once it works, you can rename it back to F2 (or decide a different key is simpler).  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Confirm** your system actually recognizes F2 with a basic script and/or Key History.  \n- **Verify** that **Win+H** works with a simple short-press script.  \n- **Add** the long-press logic (KeyWait) along with some debug beeps to ensure you can see what’s happening.  \n- If all else fails, try a different key, run AHK as admin, or re-check your laptop’s Fn key settings.  \n\nWith these steps, you should be able to either get the script working or diagnose exactly where things are failing.

It also preserves the default right-click behavior so that short presses (normal clicks) still work as usual.\n\n---\n\n## Basic Concept\n\n1. **Use `~RButton::`**: The `~` (tilde) prefix ensures that AutoHotkey does not block or suppress the normal right-click action.  \n2. **Use `KeyWait`** with a timeout to distinguish **long press** vs. **short press**.  \n3. **If `KeyWait` returns `\"Timeout\"`,** it means the button is still held after the specified time (e.g. 0.5 seconds).\n\n---\n\n## Example Script\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n#Persistent\n\n~RButton:: {\n    ; Optional: a quick beep or debug message to know the script fired.\n    ; SoundBeep 1500, 50\n\n    ; Wait up to 0.5 seconds to see if RButton is still held.\n    result := KeyWait(\"RButton\", \"T0.5\")\n    if (result = \"Timeout\") {\n        ; The button was NOT released by 0.5s (long press),\n        ; so let's send Win+H to activate dictation.\n        Send \"#h\"\n\n        ; If you want to completely block the default context menu \n        ; when a long press occurs, you can do so by \"eating\" \n        ; the up-event:\n        ; KeyWait(\"RButton\")  ; Wait for release\n        ; Return immediately after to prevent the OS from\n        ; seeing the normal right-click up-event.\n\n    } else {\n        ; The button was released quickly (short press), \n        ; so do nothing special here.\n        ; Because of the tilde (~), the normal right-click \n        ; context menu will appear.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`~RButton::`**  \n   - The tilde means “don’t block the default right-click action.” \n   - If you want to **block** the normal right-click entirely and only do your own action, remove `~` (but then you’ll lose the context menu for short presses).  \n\n2. **`result := KeyWait(\"RButton\", \"T0.5\")`**  \n   - Waits up to 0.5 seconds for RButton to be released.  \n   - Returns `\"\"` (empty string) if you release RButton before 0.5s (short press).  \n   - Returns `\"Timeout\"` if the key is still down at 0.5s (long press).  \n\n3. **Long Press → `Send \"#h\"`**  \n   - If `result` is `\"Timeout\"`, we send **Win+H** to trigger Windows dictation.  \n\n4. **Preserving or Blocking the Default Right-Click**  \n   - With `~RButton::`, the default context menu still appears on a normal click.  \n   - If you’d rather block the right-click menu altogether (for both short and long presses), remove the tilde and consider adding a `return` at the end of the long-press path.  \n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting & Tips\n\n1. **Mouse vs. Trackpad**: Some trackpads might treat right-click differently. If you aren’t seeing the script fire at all, check AHK’s **Key History** (right-click tray icon → Open → View → Key history).  \n2. **Timing**: Adjust `T0.5` to make the “long-press” threshold longer or shorter, e.g., `T0.3` or `T1`.  \n3. **Blocking the Context Menu** (optional):  \n   - If you don’t want a context menu on long press but **do** want it on short press, you can selectively block the up-event only when it’s a long press. For example:\n     ```ahk\n     if (result = \"Timeout\") {\n         Send \"#h\"\n         ; Now eat the mouse up event so the context menu won't appear\n         KeyWait(\"RButton\")  \n         return\n     }\n     ```\n4. **Run as Admin**: If **Win+H** isn’t triggered, try running AutoHotkey as Administrator.  \n\nWith this script, you can effectively turn a **right-button long press** into the **Win+H** dictation shortcut—without disrupting the normal right-click menu for short presses."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"4d4ec04f-bbdd-4877-bc34-279d746a4c08","request_id":"90010fd799c9e81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4d4ec04f-bbdd-4877-bc34-279d746a4c08","children":["aaa235c7-53ee-4570-bf6a-a15bc7bd88e5"]},"aaa235c7-53ee-4570-bf6a-a15bc7bd88e5":{"id":"aaa235c7-53ee-4570-bf6a-a15bc7bd88e5","message":{"id":"aaa235c7-53ee-4570-bf6a-a15bc7bd88e5","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736558284.721995,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Error: This line does not contain a recognized action.\r\n\r\nText:\t#Persistent\r\nLine:\t2\r\nFile:\tC:\\Users\\Owner\\Documents\\AutoHotkey\\Dictation_Mouse.ahk\r\n\r\nThe program will exit."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9001121b5d5fe81a-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1d343541-e80b-479b-8fe6-b25d15103aef","children":["3dfdbf7c-db9c-4c6c-b41a-7bd521bb16a0"]},"3dfdbf7c-db9c-4c6c-b41a-7bd521bb16a0":{"id":"3dfdbf7c-db9c-4c6c-b41a-7bd521bb16a0","message":{"id":"3dfdbf7c-db9c-4c6c-b41a-7bd521bb16a0","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1736558303.348285,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Evaluating AHK directives**\n\nI’m noting that #Persistent works in AHK v2, but the issue might involve omitting the #Requires directive or confusion with AHK v1.\n\n**Evaluating script specifics**\n\nI’m looking at the potential issue with #Persistent not being recognized due to script errors, invisible characters, or indentation, and considering the user's version of AHK.\n\n**Identifying potential issues**\n\nI’m piecing together that the issue might stem from an older AHK version, incorrect typing, or missing #Requires, especially if the script includes #Requires AutoHotkey v2.0 but runs in v1.\n\n**Adjusting my approach**\n\nI’m considering if #Persistent is necessary with an existing hotkey and suggesting a switch to a v1 script if the user is using AHK v2."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Thought about right-click long press scripting for 10 seconds","initial_text":"Thinking","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa235c7-53ee-4570-bf6a-a15bc7bd88e5","request_id":"9001121b5d5fe81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa235c7-53ee-4570-bf6a-a15bc7bd88e5","children":["9aab9ce0-0465-4df5-866f-7b9a55a8fb7e"]},"9aab9ce0-0465-4df5-866f-7b9a55a8fb7e":{"id":"9aab9ce0-0465-4df5-866f-7b9a55a8fb7e","message":{"id":"9aab9ce0-0465-4df5-866f-7b9a55a8fb7e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736558303.348404,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["In many cases, **#Persistent** isn’t actually needed—especially if your script already has a hotkey (like `~RButton::`), since the presence of a hotkey automatically keeps the script running. More importantly, **the error often occurs if you’re mixing AutoHotkey v1 and v2 syntax**, or if there’s a hidden typo.\n\nBelow are a few ways to fix it:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Remove `#Persistent` if you have a hotkey\n\nIf your script *only* contains hotkeys or hotstrings, **you do not need** `#Persistent`. Having at least one hotkey/hotstring keeps the script running on its own. So you can simply **remove** the line:\n\n```ahk\n; Remove or comment out the line below:\n; #Persistent\n\n~RButton:: {\n    result := KeyWait(\"RButton\", \"T0.5\")\n    if (result = \"Timeout\") {\n        Send \"#h\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat should eliminate the error because you already have a hotkey (`~RButton::`), and the script will stay running.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Verify which version of AHK you’re running\n\n- **AutoHotkey v2** requires different syntax than v1.  \n- **#Persistent** does still exist in v2, but you must ensure your script has the correct v2 headers (especially `#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0`) *and* that you’re actually launching it with the v2 interpreter.\n\n### If you want to use v2 syntax:\n\n```ahk\n#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n\n; If you really need #Persistent (e.g. no hotkeys):\n#Persistent\n\n~RButton:: {\n    result := KeyWait(\"RButton\", \"T0.5\")\n    if (result = \"Timeout\") {\n        Send \"#h\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- Make sure “AutoHotkey64.exe” (or “AutoHotkey.exe”) is the **v2** version.  \n- Right-click the script → “Run with AutoHotkey v2” if you have both versions installed.\n\n### If you’re on AutoHotkey v1:\n\n```ahk\n#NoEnv\nSendMode Input\nSetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%\n\n; #Persistent is recognized in v1, but if you have a hotkey, you don't need it.\n; #Persistent\n\n~RButton::\nKeyWait, RButton, T0.5\nif ErrorLevel {\n    Send, #h\n}\nreturn\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Check for typos or hidden characters\n\nOccasionally, you can get that “line does not contain a recognized action” error if there’s a stray non-printable character or if you typed `#Persisent` (missing the “t”) by accident. Double-check the spelling of **#Persistent** or retype the line.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bottom line\n\n1. **If your script has at least one hotkey**, you can likely **remove** `#Persistent` altogether.  \n2. **Ensure the script’s syntax matches the version of AutoHotkey** you’re running (v1 vs. v2). In v2, you typically start your script with:\n   ```ahk\n   #Requires AutoHotkey v2.0\n   ```\n3. **Make sure you’re actually launching the correct version**. If you installed v2 but the .ahk extension is still associated with v1, you can get unexpected syntax errors.  \n\nBy removing or correcting `#Persistent` and matching your AHK version/syntax, you should eliminate the error and get your script running."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"3dfdbf7c-db9c-4c6c-b41a-7bd521bb16a0","request_id":"9001121b5d5fe81a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3dfdbf7c-db9c-4c6c-b41a-7bd521bb16a0","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"9aab9ce0-0465-4df5-866f-7b9a55a8fb7e","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"6781c25e-b030-8002-a91a-22a61548c3af","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":["https://www.autohotkey.com/"],"default_model_slug":"o1","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
