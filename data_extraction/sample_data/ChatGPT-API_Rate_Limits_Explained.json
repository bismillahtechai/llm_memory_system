and Anthropic both implement API rate limits to manage usage and ensure fair access. Here's a comparison of their approaches:\n\n**OpenRouter API Rate Limits**:\n\n- **Free Models**:\n  - *Per Minute*: Up to 20 requests.\n  - *Per Day*: Up to 200 requests.\n\n- **General Rate Limits**:\n  - Tied to available credits, allowing 1 request per second for each credit.\n  - Minimum of 1 request per second for accounts with at least 0.5 credits.\n\n- **DDoS Protection**:\n  - Utilizes Cloudflare's protection to block excessive requests.\n\n- **Negative Credit Balance**:\n  - Accounts below zero balance may encounter `402` errors, even with free models.\n\n**Anthropic API Rate Limits**:\n\n- **Usage Tiers**:\n  - Limits are defined by usage tiers, with each tier associated with different sets of spend and rate limits. Organizations automatically advance tiers as they reach specific thresholds.\n\n- **Rate Limits**:\n  - Measured in requests per minute (RPM), tokens per minute (TPM), and tokens per day (TPD).\n  - For example, the \"Claude 3.5 Sonnet\" model has a limit of 5 RPM, 20,000 TPM, and 300,000 TPD.\n\n- **Response Headers**:\n  - The API response includes headers indicating the rate limit enforced, current usage, and reset times.\n\n- **Handling Rate Limit Errors**:\n  - Exceeding limits results in a `429` error, with a `retry-after` header specifying the wait time before retrying.\n\n**Key Differences**:\n\n- **Rate Limiting Approach**:\n  - OpenRouter's rate limits are primarily tied to the user's available credits, allowing flexibility based on credit balance.\n  - Anthropic employs fixed rate limits based on usage tiers and model specifications, with automatic tier advancement as usage increases.\n\n- **Monitoring Usage**:\n  - OpenRouter provides a specific endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/key`) to monitor rate limits and credit usage.\n  - Anthropic includes rate limit information in API response headers, offering real-time insights into current usage and limits.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is crucial for effectively managing API usage within each platform's guidelines. "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"search_source":"composer_auto","client_reported_search_source":"composer_auto","search_result_groups":[{"type":"search_result_group","domain":"anthropic.com","entries":[{"type":"search_result","url":"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits","title":"Rate limits - Anthropic","snippet":"Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.

Here’s why:\n\n### **Why OpenRouter Might Be More Effective:**\n1. **No Token-Based Rate Limits**  \n   - Anthropic enforces limits on **requests per minute (RPM), tokens per minute (TPM), and tokens per day (TPD)**, meaning you can hit a cap based on token usage, even if you're sending relatively few requests.  \n   - OpenRouter **only limits requests per second (RPS)**, not token usage per request. This means you can send **larger prompts and get longer responses** without worrying about TPM or TPD restrictions.\n\n2. **Scaling with Credits**  \n   - OpenRouter dynamically scales your request rate based on **available credits**. If you need to make more requests per second, you can **increase your credits** rather than waiting for rate limits to reset.  \n   - Anthropic uses **fixed tier-based limits** that don’t scale instantly—moving up in tiers depends on cumulative usage over time.\n\n3. **More Flexible Rate Handling**  \n   - If you exceed Anthropic’s limits, you get **hard-blocked (`429` errors) until the reset window**.  \n   - OpenRouter **spreads requests out** based on credits, meaning fewer abrupt interruptions.\n\n### **When OpenRouter is the Better Choice:**\n✅ You need to send **longer prompts or get longer responses** without worrying about hitting a token cap.  \n✅ You're running into **Anthropic’s rate limits** and need an alternative that doesn’t throttle based on tokens.  \n✅ You want a **pay-as-you-go** model where increasing credits allows more frequent requests rather than waiting for tier upgrades.  \n\n### **When Anthropic Might Still Be Better:**\n🚫 If you **only need occasional low-volume access** and don't want to manage credit-based scaling.  \n🚫 If OpenRouter doesn’t support the specific Anthropic model or features you need.  \n🚫 If you're part of Anthropic's higher-tier API plans, where limits are higher and OpenRouter’s pricing might not be as competitive.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nIf **rate limits on Anthropic** are slowing you down, **OpenRouter can be a better way to access the same models with more flexibility**, especially for **large-token requests and consistent high-volume usage**."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"a078da09-3fd9-4fd8-b263-1b2490168c3b","request_id":"919d4577ffbbf159-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-canmore","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","description":"This model doesn't support search."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-canmore","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_search","description":"This model doesn't support search."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a078da09-3fd9-4fd8-b263-1b2490168c3b","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"20c37ce3-1b7c-46d6-917b-5a017728239b","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67c3b991-b680-8002-b4b2-ddd12ae97a64","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":["https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/limits?utm_source=chatgpt.com","https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/limits"],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
