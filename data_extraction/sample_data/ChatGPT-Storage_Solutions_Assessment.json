so we moved out of the house that me and my wife were living in and we had a mortgage on it we were paying approximately $2700 a month and we moved in with my mother-in-law who is living by herself my mother-in-law has a four bedroom house but she has a lot of stuff as well and we put all of our stuff into storage initially we were paying 250 for the storage space but now the price has gone up to 415 and then I also rented a separate storage space for my work stuff and I'm paying for 50 ish for that storage space together I'm paying a 75 for both storage units and its total of 675 square feet eventually we will move out of my mother-in-law's house hopefully my mother-in-law will move with us we're thinking about building a place and then I cannot move out together and lower our costs of living and hopefully get on better financial footing but right now I'm looking for out-of-the-box solutions on what I can do with all of my stuff and where I can put it and how I can either eliminate that 875 then I'm paying for storage or put that $875 to a different type of space or maybe I can put a little bit more like maybe $1000 to a different type of space move all of the stuff there as well and then I can use that space for something else like a dedicated workspace but the problem is the only thing that I'm finding is essentially a flex warehouse space for small businesses and the only thing they have available is 1750 a month on a one year agreement I would be able to move everything into that space as well as use it for working out of bye I don't know if it's worth the extra $1000 a month they say that it's perfect for one to six employees it fits 30 to 40 pallets with the pallet racks that they include I can add more of my own pallet racks right now I'm in self storage so there's no power racks but I do have like a steel shelving it also includes electric and Wi-Fi and it has 24/7 access 24/7 support and security it's climate controlled which I don't have right now it has a conference room a kitchen a lounge loading docks it has warehouse equipment so they have pallet jacks pallet stackers forklifts dollies hand trucks alright I'm just trying to go through the pros and cons they also have another office space that's becoming available in the same building the space that I'm talking about now is dedicated warehouse flex space that I can also just set up a desk in but it's essentially warehouse space and they have a private office that's also becoming available it's a small private office that you'd be able to set up one large desk or two small desks and that's another $500 a month so I need help kind of figuring out what to do the problem is they don't provide exact measurements I think it's 24 by 24 by 10 and right now I have two units one is 12 by 30 and the other is 10 by 30 and it's basically self storage unconditioned I only have access from nine 6:00 AM to 9:00

is a step-by-step thought process on how you might approach deciding what to do with your storage situation, followed by some outside-the-box ideas worth considering. Let’s break it down.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Assess What You Currently Have\n\n1. **Current Monthly Cost**  \n   - Storage Unit #1 (12×30): \\$415/month  \n   - Storage Unit #2 (10×30): \\$450/month  \n   - **Total**: \\$865/month (you mentioned \\$875, so it’s about \\$865–\\$875 total).  \n\n2. **Access & Features**  \n   - Limited access (6 AM–9 PM).  \n   - No climate control.  \n   - No dedicated workspace.  \n   - No common-area amenities or conference rooms.  \n\n3. **Amount of Stuff**  \n   - Combined square footage: 12×30 + 10×30 = **360 + 300 = 660** sq. ft.  \n   - You also said it’s about **675 sq. ft.** total.  \n   - This is **unconditioned** space (no AC/heat).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Evaluate the New Flex Warehouse Option\n\nYou found a space that costs **\\$1,750/month** (potentially \\$2,250/month if you add the private office). It offers:\n\n1. **Amenities**  \n   - Climate control, 24/7 access, forklifts, pallet jacks, Wi-Fi, electricity, security, loading docks, conference room, lounge, and more.  \n   - This is obviously far more than just a storage space.  \n   - Potential for an office area within the warehouse—though not a true private office unless you pay another \\$500.  \n\n2. **Size**  \n   - Possibly ~24×24×10 (not fully confirmed). That’s about **576 sq. ft.** of floor space if it’s truly 24×24.  \n   - The warehouse might stack better vertically because you could add pallet racks (they already have some racks, and you can add more).  \n\n3. **Value of Amenities**  \n   - If you need a workshop, a place to meet clients or employees, or a spot to store inventory (especially for your remodeling/roofing tools) under climate-controlled conditions, having those built-in amenities can save you from renting other office spaces, coworking desks, or paying for forklift/pallet jack rentals.  \n   - If you genuinely plan to grow your business and need a legit place to operate from (with 1–6 employees), the difference in cost could be offset by business advantages.  \n\n4. **Cost Difference**  \n   - Going from \\$875/month up to \\$1,750/month is **\\$875 more** each month.  \n   - If you add the \\$500 office, that’s a jump of **\\$1,375** more monthly than you pay now.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Decide If the Additional \\$875–\\$1,375/Month Is “Worth It”\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n1. **Could a proper workspace help you grow your revenue quickly?**  \n   - If this space allows you to bring on employees, hold meetings with customers, and store materials in bulk at cheaper prices, it might boost your capacity—and your revenue. The extra monthly cost could pay for itself if it accelerates your business.  \n\n2. **Do you truly need all the amenities right now?**  \n   - If you’re mostly storing personal household items plus some tools/materials, paying for forklift access, conference rooms, etc., might be overkill unless you’ll really use them.  \n\n3. **How long will you stay?**  \n   - They require a **one-year agreement**. If your living (and storage) situation might drastically change in 6 months, you could be locked in.  \n\n4. **Could you sublease or share the warehouse space with a partner?**  \n   - If you only need half (or less) of that warehouse, you might consider a sublease arrangement (officially or unofficially) with another trustworthy small business. This could split costs and make it more affordable.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Outside-the-Box Options\n\nIf jumping to \\$1,750/month seems steep, here are other creative ways to handle storage and/or an office.\n\n1. **Buy a Shipping Container and Park It**  \n   - Purchase or rent a 20-ft or 40-ft shipping container (new or used).  \n   - Park it on someone’s property (family, friend) or lease a small plot of land.  \n   - Insulate it or add basic climate control if needed.  \n   - **Pros**: Long-term savings if you own the container outright, 24/7 access, you can store items + possibly create a small workshop.  \n   - **Cons**: You must find suitable land and handle any zoning or HOA regulations.\n\n2. **Garage or Pole Barn on Your Mother-in-Law’s Property (or Another Relative’s Land)**  \n   - If your mother-in-law has enough space in the backyard (and local regulations allow it), consider building or installing a prefabricated shed/garage/pole barn.  \n   - **Pros**: On-site 24/7 access, potentially cheaper in the long run, you build equity by owning the structure.  \n   - **Cons**: Initial costs to build can be high, requires local permits, the timeline might be longer.\n\n3. **Look for a Local Farmer or Commercial Property with Extra Space**  \n   - Sometimes farmland, industrial yards, or even underused commercial buildings will rent out partial space for less than typical storage units.  \n   - **Pros**: Often cheaper than formal self-storage or fancy flex spaces.  \n   - **Cons**: May be remote, less secure, might not have climate control or amenities.\n\n4. **Shared Makerspace or Cooperative Workspace with Storage**  \n   - Some cities have warehouses used by artists, makers, or hobby clubs. They typically have membership-based access.  \n   - **Pros**: Community environment, shared tools (some even have woodshops or metalworking equipment), possible synergy with others for your remodeling/roofing business.  \n   - **Cons**: Storage space might be limited, security varies, can be messy/noisy if it’s a big makerspace.\n\n5. **Rent a Smaller Warehouse Bay (Month-to-Month)**  \n   - Search for local “small bay warehouse” or “mini-warehouse” solutions. Often you can find 500–1,000 sq. ft. spots for around \\$700–\\$1,200/month.  \n   - **Pros**: More flexible than a one-year contract at \\$1,750/month, more space than a storage locker, and you can set up shelving.  \n   - **Cons**: Not as fancy with climate control or forklift access, but often cheaper.\n\n6. **Temporary PODS or Portable Storage**  \n   - If you only need short-term storage while sorting through items you might eventually purge or move, consider PODS or similar portable storage solutions.  \n   - **Pros**: They drop it off at your mother-in-law’s driveway or other location. You only pay for the container + monthly fee. Access is instant if it’s on your property.  \n   - **Cons**: Might not be cost-effective if you need it for a long time. Also can’t typically use it as a workspace.\n\n7. **Aggressive Decluttering / Selling Off**  \n   - If you anticipate eventually moving into a new house and your mother-in-law joining, ask: “How much of this storage do I truly need?”  \n   - Selling off furniture or items you don’t 100% need could reduce your storage footprint from 675 sq. ft. to maybe half that, saving you significant money each month.  \n   - Use the freed-up cash for partial coworking membership if you need a workspace.\n\n8. **Sublease a Section of a Larger Warehouse from Another Business**  \n   - You mentioned a space that accommodates 30–40 pallets. Another local business might be renting that warehouse and only using half of it. They might be open to renting out some space for a fraction of the cost.  \n   - **Pros**: Shared overhead, possibly month-to-month or shorter lease.  \n   - **Cons**: Security and access might rely on the other tenant’s schedule.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Compare and Crunch the Numbers\n\nOnce you have a few realistic options, do a side-by-side cost analysis. For instance, let’s assume you consider three main scenarios:\n\n1. **Stay With Current Storage**  \n   - **Cost**: \\$875/month.  \n   - **Pros**: Already in place, no new contracts.  \n   - **Cons**: No workspace, limited hours, no climate control.\n\n2. **Jump to the \\$1,750 Flex Warehouse**  \n   - **Cost**: \\$1,750/month (could be \\$2,250 if you add the private office).  \n   - **Pros**: Great amenities, 24/7 access, forklift, Wi-Fi, climate control.  \n   - **Cons**: Extra \\$875–\\$1,375 per month, 1-year lease, might be overkill if you don’t fully use it.\n\n3. **Creative Solution (Shipping Container, Shared Warehouse, or Private Bay)**  \n   - **Cost**: Could range from \\$300–\\$1,200/month or a one-time investment for a container + land rental.  \n   - **Pros**: Potentially 24/7 access, possibly more flexible.  \n   - **Cons**: Might involve more legwork to arrange, fewer amenities.\n\nUse rough numbers to see how each solution fits your budget and your business needs.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Make a Decision that Balances Cost + Business Growth\n\n- If you plan to **scale your business** soon, need a more professional environment, and can realistically recoup the extra costs through increased revenue, the **flex warehouse** might be a solid investment.  \n- If your move is **short-term** and you only need cost savings, look into **cheaper or partial warehouse** options, or maybe **create a custom solution** (container, renting farmland, etc.).  \n- A middle-ground approach might be **reducing your storage volume** by selling/donating items you won’t need in the new house and then **finding a smaller, cheaper warehouse bay** so you can also have a workspace.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the Thought Process\n\n1. **Identify** the key reasons you need storage + workspace.  \n2. **List** all realistic options and their pros/cons.  \n3. **Compare** costs, commitment terms, and potential revenue impact.  \n4. **Decide** if the extra cost can be offset by business growth or if you can downsize storage needs.  \n\n---\n\n## Final Suggestions\n\n1. **Dig deeper for alternative small-bay warehouse spaces** – sometimes even 500–800 sq. ft. with month-to-month might pop up if you check Facebook Marketplace, local commercial real estate groups, or talk to other contractors who might share space.  \n2. **Try decluttering aggressively** – see if you can downsize from two units to one, or at least a smaller footprint.  \n3. **Consider a shipping container** – especially if you can place it somewhere with 24/7 access and not violate local rules.  \n4. **If you need a professional setting to meet clients** – the \\$1,750 warehouse with amenities might be justified, especially if it helps you generate more business.\n\nBy weighing these options carefully, you’ll find a solution that balances your **current** budget constraints with your **future** growth plans.
