Now, even if he does does move forward with this process, it’s a process and like he said the first step is sending a notice of intent to lean. The notice is just a letter. It doesn’t trigger anything with the property. It’s not filed anywhere in public records. it’s just a notice that is sent and it needs to be sent via certified mail and even the process to send the notice won’t happen right away even if his lawyer sends it today the earliest you could possibly get it would be maybe tomorrow or Monday. And then, after you receive the notice, then he can actually move forward with filing a lien which that itself is a process, and this whole process cost him money. Alex isn’t stupid. The most logical thing for him would be for us to have them come back complete the rest of the work and pay him everything because that’s in his best interest and that’s in our best interest. The problem is he just hasn’t heard from anybody. He doesn’t know what’s going on. So with all this being said we have until at least Monday morning to be able to put together a project plan and schedule, which would include when we would need him to come back when we would call for a rough inspection for plumbing and when he would get paid.
