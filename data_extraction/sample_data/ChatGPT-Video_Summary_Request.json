I\n00:08:14.800 made the mistake of making a video and\n00:08:18.199 the video is entitled why you shouldn't\n00:08:20.520 resist watching porn and people\n00:08:23.759 understandably um the the video I guess\n00:08:26.080 is doing pretty well cuz it was uploaded\n00:08:27.800 like I don't know like a week ago and\n00:08:29.919 it's got 700,000 views I don't quite\n00:08:32.599 understand what this comment means by\n00:08:33.919 the way so if youall could explain this\n00:08:35.080 to me that would be great um therapist\n00:08:37.479 when the credit card gets declined I\n00:08:39.159 don't I don't know why this has 19,000\n00:08:40.919 up\n00:08:41.799 votes but everyone is I I can somebody\n00:08:45.720 explain this to me like what does this\n00:08:48.080 mean um we're going to talk about\n00:08:49.959 clickbait in a second but I I don't know\n00:08:52.560 what that\n00:08:53.360 means literally like I I don't I mean I\n00:08:56.360 should\n00:08:57.279 know um\n00:09:01.200 so so this is once again one of those\n00:09:03.040 things where it's like even though I try\n00:09:05.120 to be one of y'all um it's really\n00:09:08.680 challenging\n00:09:10.399 to oh you take the service back okay but\n00:09:13.880 what what does that have to do with the\n00:09:14.920 video I'm\n00:09:17.480 confused oh implying your okay I see I\n00:09:21.560 see I see I see I see okay thank you so\n00:09:23.959 much for explaining it chat I thank you\n00:09:26.720 I would be lost without y'all y'all are\n00:09:28.720 great um so let me just talk for a\n00:09:31.200 second about\n00:09:32.200 clickbait so some people saw the title\n00:09:34.519 of this video and they were like this\n00:09:36.320 video is super clickbait until you watch\n00:09:38.959 it and you know the video's I I guess\n00:09:42.600 it's good right so I I think that like I\n00:09:44.720 I think when we make videos that are\n00:09:46.320 clickbait that are like just clickbait\n00:09:49.320 right so it's clickbait like the idea is\n00:09:51.600 that like you think there's something of\n00:09:53.040 value in there when you open it up\n00:09:54.600 there's nothing of value that's what\n00:09:55.920 clickbait is it's a scam but in this\n00:09:58.200 video especially like I think the reason\n00:10:00.040 it's doing so well is because there's\n00:10:01.680 like a lot of good stuff in it and so it\n00:10:04.760 looks like a clickbait title and it kind\n00:10:06.680 of makes sense but like literally that's\n00:10:09.000 what the video is about there's this\n00:10:10.360 really fascinating principle of\n00:10:11.760 addiction that if you resist a craving\n00:10:15.040 so if you resist like a level five\n00:10:17.200 craving and then like your body goes up\n00:10:19.600 to a level eight craving and then you\n00:10:22.120 fail at resisting that higher level of\n00:10:24.160 craving what the body does over time is\n00:10:27.279 increases straight to eight so so it's\n00:10:29.600 like five doesn't get us what we need so\n00:10:31.920 we're going to go straight to eight this\n00:10:33.680 like this is like a science thing okay\n00:10:35.279 it's like we know this so the video\n00:10:37.839 talks about that and literally if we\n00:10:40.079 look at like you know I don't know if\n00:10:41.839 this kind of makes sense but sometimes\n00:10:43.959 what happens when you're addicted to\n00:10:45.279 something is that if you fight every\n00:10:47.800 single\n00:10:48.920 battle like you're going to be\n00:10:50.920 cognitively exhausted and you're not\n00:10:52.480 going to win all of them and losing a\n00:10:54.200 single one strangely enough like can can\n00:10:56.720 create such big problems it's a really\n00:10:58.120 weird concept\n00:11:01.160 so here's kind of how we see it the\n00:11:03.600 first is we're going to title things in\n00:11:07.560 a way that that is geared to provide\n00:11:11.160 people with the information that we are\n00:11:13.760 trying to disseminate like we're going\n00:11:15.639 to title things to try to help people\n00:11:18.639 that being said we recognize that there\n00:11:21.200 is clickbait out there and that we are\n00:11:23.800 somewhat guilty of that and so we take\n00:11:26.000 that very seriously we appreciate yall's\n00:11:27.880 feedback very seriously I was super\n00:11:29.959 surprised I mean I think it makes sense\n00:11:31.800 but I really did not when I was making\n00:11:33.600 this video I was not thinking about\n00:11:35.880 clickbait I was like this is a really\n00:11:37.440 important principle that people need to\n00:11:39.800 understand that is Mindless resistance\n00:11:42.360 can sometimes lead to the wrong\n00:11:44.440 conclusion and if y all like remember\n00:11:46.600 growing up and your parents would just\n00:11:48.200 fight you every single time you wanted\n00:11:49.880 to play a video game or every single\n00:11:51.279 time you wanted to do this they were\n00:11:52.440 just resisting resisting resisting\n00:11:53.880 resisting resisting you resisting you\n00:11:55.360 resisting you it doesn't end up in the\n00:11:57.600 right direction which is really weird\n00:11:59.399 thing right because we think oh like you\n00:12:00.600 have to resist all the time so like\n00:12:02.800 focal targeted resistance is what really\n00:12:04.920 leads to like good outcomes in my\n00:12:07.839 experience so this was not attempting to\n00:12:10.360 be clickbait this was like and that's\n00:12:12.320 why I think the video does well is\n00:12:13.519 because like I I sort of explained that\n00:12:15.199 and people like oh that's really\n00:12:16.320 interesting and I think it helps people\n00:12:17.760 a lot which is what we're here for so\n00:12:19.519 we're going to continue titling things\n00:12:20.839 that way at the same time we recognize\n00:12:24.120 that our titles can be clickbait and so\n00:12:26.440 we are working on mitigating that right\n00:12:28.519 so we're not going to make\n00:12:29.720 I think I hope we're not going to make\n00:12:31.079 super click baity titles and also we're\n00:12:33.440 going to start adding like uh more\n00:12:36.800 detailed description uh either in a\n00:12:39.399 pinned comment or in the video\n00:12:40.959 description about what the video is\n00:12:42.399 actually about so if y'all are concerned\n00:12:44.680 that like because we the problem is that\n00:12:46.279 we only have like six words or something\n00:12:49.360 like that right like that's we have to\n00:12:51.440 encapsulate the whole video in six words\n00:12:54.519 so that's very hard to do like I'm\n00:12:57.040 [ __ ] longwinded chat like that's\n00:13:00.279 you know so so so we're going to try to\n00:13:02.240 fix that so for those of y'all For Whom\n00:13:04.000 the clickbait is bothersome we apologize\n00:13:07.160 and also you'll find a more detailed\n00:13:09.519 description of what the video is about\n00:13:12.040 that is\n00:13:13.120 more justifiably explained in a pin\n00:13:16.560 comment or description a couple of other\n00:13:18.839 things that we're working on are\n00:13:21.320 citations so this is where it's kind of\n00:13:24.240 like complicated\n00:13:26.760 but so when we make a video there aren't\n00:13:30.079 particular citations for that video okay\n00:13:33.160 so just to give you all an example hold\n00:13:35.880 on\n00:13:40.040 one so like the way that we do research\n00:13:43.040 here at HG is it's not like we set out\n00:13:45.399 to make a video and then we do research\n00:13:47.480 on that topic and then like all of those\n00:13:50.240 pieces of research are go into the video\n00:13:53.920 what happens is we will thoroughly\n00:13:55.720 thoroughly research and continue to\n00:13:57.680 research topics so for example like if\n00:14:00.320 yall let me just pull something up um\n00:14:03.680 just to show you all real\n00:14:05.959 quick hold on a second we're going to\n00:14:08.320 get to ADHD Doomer real quick don't\n00:14:10.040 worry\n00:14:12.959 chat okay so if we look at this for\n00:14:19.720 example\n00:14:25.000 um so like the way that we do research\n00:14:27.560 at HG is we'll like we'll look at a lot\n00:14:30.279 of research right so this is like\n00:14:31.680 functional neuro anatomy of pleasure and\n00:14:33.800 happiness nucleus accumbent modulation\n00:14:37.079 reward and aversion um like Raji yog\n00:14:40.480 meditation induces gray matter volume\n00:14:42.480 changes in regions that process reward\n00:14:44.399 and\n00:14:45.120 happiness the structural neural\n00:14:47.000 substrate of subjective happiness\n00:14:49.279 nucleus encumbrance comprehensive review\n00:14:51.880 neurochemistry of the nucleus succumbent\n00:14:53.680 and its relevance to depression and\n00:14:55.000 anti-depressant action in in rodents and\n00:14:57.880 then the nucleus succumbent an interface\n00:14:59.839 between cognition emotion and action so\n00:15:02.360 the way that we do research at HG is\n00:15:04.880 it's not like we do research for a\n00:15:06.480 specific video we will comprehensively\n00:15:09.600 look at a particular topic and then what\n00:15:12.920 happens is like if I make a video on\n00:15:14.519 depression and I'll read let's say I've\n00:15:17.040 read let's say over the last year\n00:15:19.440 probably pretty accurate estimate let's\n00:15:20.839 say 50 art or let's use trauma so over\n00:15:24.360 the last year and a half I've read about\n00:15:26.360 400 peer-reviewed articles on trauma\n00:15:29.880 now anytime we make a video on\n00:15:33.000 trauma like we don't necessarily have a\n00:15:35.680 bibliography for that video so instead\n00:15:37.560 what we're going to do is share with\n00:15:38.759 y'all the way that we actually do like\n00:15:40.839 our research so we're developing a web\n00:15:43.279 page that has all of our citations based\n00:15:46.000 on a particular\n00:15:47.519 topic and then what tends to happen is\n00:15:49.880 like if I read like 10 papers right what\n00:15:53.199 I'll do is like I'll use six of those\n00:15:54.920 papers in one video and then I'll use\n00:15:58.399 two of those same six plus these\n00:16:00.759 additional four plus two video two uh\n00:16:04.160 things about some other topic and like\n00:16:06.480 that'll be it for the next one so we\n00:16:07.959 like read a lot of stuff and I think the\n00:16:10.440 citations in every video is not really\n00:16:13.600 working out well for us like because\n00:16:15.440 that's not practically how we do it so\n00:16:17.560 we recognize that people like citations\n00:16:19.519 and they want further reading so we're\n00:16:21.040 developing a resource for that it'll\n00:16:22.639 probably start out like a web page that\n00:16:24.600 gets continuously updated and part of\n00:16:27.079 the other reason that we want to do that\n00:16:28.319 is we're do building building this as a\n00:16:29.480 resource so like why do people like\n00:16:31.279 citations I mean I I don't know why yall\n00:16:33.560 like citations but generally speaking I\n00:16:35.079 think of citations as hey I want to\n00:16:37.519 learn more about this topic so what is\n00:16:39.279 the most useful thing for us to do for\n00:16:41.680 yall as a community it's like if you're\n00:16:43.759 like hey I want to understand ADHD and\n00:16:47.000 obesity we're like okay cool here's a\n00:16:49.880 bunch of papers about that topic that\n00:16:52.880 you all can take a look at on your own\n00:16:54.920 so we're we're working on that stuff\n00:16:57.279 couple of points one is just that we we\n00:16:58.959 take this feedback very seriously so\n00:17:01.199 when yall post stuff like this like you\n00:17:02.560 know we're working on it we're working\n00:17:04.400 on it um and thank youall very much for\n00:17:06.760 the feedback right so for the clickbait\n00:17:08.359 titles like I I get that there's some\n00:17:10.839 con concerns about it we're continuously\n00:17:13.119 trying to find the balance\n00:17:14.959 between making a title\n00:17:17.640 that gets people interested in the\n00:17:20.760 information that we're offering and\n00:17:22.720 making a title that\n00:17:25.280 is accurate to the content of the video\n00:17:29.200 I happen to think that this porn\n00:17:30.600 addiction one is actually like pretty\n00:17:32.240 accurate like that's what the video is\n00:17:33.880 like literally about the downside to\n00:17:36.160 resisting cravings and a mechanism that\n00:17:38.679 many people don't understand which is I\n00:17:40.320 think part of the reason why people\n00:17:41.559 struggle with addiction so much we don't\n00:17:43.360 know how it really affects our brain so\n00:17:46.200 that's by the way what we're going to be\n00:17:47.200 talking about today but not addiction so\n00:17:49.360 we're going to be talking about\n00:17:52.559 um uh like ADHD Doomer related stuff\n00:17:56.280 okay so got a a lot of cool posts to\n00:17:58.880 talk about um one other thing speaking\n00:18:00.799 of trauma so we you know we our trauma\n00:18:03.760 guide is like available for pre-order\n00:18:05.640 now finally so I started working on this\n00:18:08.159 thing like two and a half years two\n00:18:10.000 years ago let's say I think our last\n00:18:12.440 guide came out maybe in 2022 so we've\n00:18:15.360 been working on this for about two years\n00:18:18.320 um and that's how long it takes to build\n00:18:19.880 one like it's not it's not like a quick\n00:18:21.840 oneandone kind of thing so it's\n00:18:23.919 available for pre-order y'all can use\n00:18:25.400 the command exclamation point trauma to\n00:18:27.840 check it out um it's I mean I say this\n00:18:30.039 for every guide that I write but it's\n00:18:32.039 the one that I'm the most proud of In\n00:18:34.120 This Moment like so you know that's what\n00:18:37.000 that's what gets me excited about things\n00:18:38.760 and stuff like that um I think it's\n00:18:41.240 really great I think it's a guide really\n00:18:45.120 about so what I got super excited about\n00:18:47.919 about the trauma guide is that we don't\n00:18:50.640 know we don't know how we get shaped\n00:18:54.799 right so like here's you and you exist\n00:18:57.400 in this present moment with all of your\n00:18:59.520 difficulties all of your challenges all\n00:19:01.880 of your advantages all of your passions\n00:19:04.600 all of your perceptions with how you\n00:19:06.360 perceive the world so like you are\n00:19:08.520 crafted based on your\n00:19:10.799 circumstances and what I love about the\n00:19:13.679 science of trauma I'm not saying trauma\n00:19:15.320 is a good thing but if you look at the\n00:19:17.039 science of trauma the science of trauma\n00:19:19.480 is the best example of how a human being\n00:19:23.039 gets formed because you have this event\n00:19:25.760 and then we investigate what is the\n00:19:27.559 impact of this event on this person's\n00:19:30.360 sense of identity on their thoughts on\n00:19:32.720 their behaviors on their physiology on\n00:19:35.600 their nervous\n00:19:36.919 system their brain like how do events\n00:19:40.240 shape people and so what we've tried to\n00:19:42.520 do in the trauma guide is we use the\n00:19:44.559 lens of trauma but we can deduce\n00:19:47.200 principles of how people get formed into\n00:19:50.080 the version that they are what is the\n00:19:52.320 process through making this person and\n00:19:56.000 our our hope is that\n00:19:59.159 in understanding these processes you can\n00:20:02.320 craft\n00:20:03.480 yourself into the kind of person that\n00:20:05.880 you want to or uncraft yourself away\n00:20:10.080 from the person that you are and so we\n00:20:12.720 we did a ton of research I've done a ton\n00:20:14.440 of work on trauma it's been one of the\n00:20:15.880 most fascinating like I love it from a\n00:20:17.679 clinical perspective it's kind of weird\n00:20:19.559 like I I love a lot of the things that\n00:20:22.000 many of my colleagues run away from\n00:20:24.039 which is like personality disorders\n00:20:26.080 addictions and Trauma those are like\n00:20:28.320 three of my favorite clinical things to\n00:20:30.440 kind of focus\n00:20:31.600 on um and so then they're all tied\n00:20:34.200 together ADHD is up there too so if\n00:20:37.120 you'all want to check it out please\n00:20:38.120 check it out it's made with a lot of\n00:20:39.600 effort a lot of love it's taken us two\n00:20:42.000 years and and it's not just me that's\n00:20:43.760 been working on it like there's a whole\n00:20:45.919 um you know we have like a whole\n00:20:47.159 creative process with a production\n00:20:49.039 company and they were really really\n00:20:50.640 helpful and they're super awesome um and\n00:20:53.480 and then we've also got like you know\n00:20:55.640 people who are like are are our D the\n00:20:58.159 people on our our Dev team are like\n00:20:59.600 designing this stuff from the ground up\n00:21:01.240 and like there's a lot of effort and\n00:21:02.919 love that goes into it and it's made for\n00:21:04.960 yall so it's not once again it's not a\n00:21:06.559 substitute for clinical treatment but\n00:21:07.880 that's not what it's designed to be\n00:21:09.799 right this is about helping yall\n00:21:11.559 understand the principles through which\n00:21:13.320 a human being is shaped and if you\n00:21:16.279 understand it's kind of like PC Master\n00:21:18.000 race for humans right so like if you\n00:21:20.320 look at PC Master race and building your\n00:21:22.120 your own computer if you want to create\n00:21:24.240 a certain PC you need to know like how\n00:21:26.840 all the parts fit together\n00:21:29.039 the problem is no one teaches us that\n00:21:30.840 and interestingly enough it's not like\n00:21:34.039 Child Development and things like that\n00:21:35.640 that I find the most fascinating about\n00:21:37.279 how a human being is developed it's\n00:21:38.919 actually trauma because those are the\n00:21:40.400 individual events that shape us right so\n00:21:43.640 this is like it's kind of like how the\n00:21:45.000 source code of who you are is laid down\n00:21:48.159 through experience and how to undo some\n00:21:51.200 of that stuff which is just super\n00:21:52.600 fascinating research I mean it's like\n00:21:53.919 mindblowing the clinical implications of\n00:21:56.400 like some of these papers and stuff like\n00:21:57.840 that\n00:21:59.080 anyway so definitely check it out but\n00:22:01.559 enough of\n00:22:02.640 that\n00:22:04.240 um and and the reason that I like it is\n00:22:06.559 because I think that's actually what our\n00:22:07.799 community needs right so everyone if you\n00:22:10.440 look at like even the post that we we're\n00:22:12.400 going to look at today everyone's like\n00:22:14.679 how do I fix this problem and the answer\n00:22:17.799 one version of the answer is almost\n00:22:20.520 always understand how you got into this\n00:22:22.799 problem in the first place how did you\n00:22:24.400 wire in this way right cuz everyone and\n00:22:27.640 then like once you understand saying the\n00:22:28.799 fundamentals of wiring then you can like\n00:22:30.720 wire into whatever you want so that's\n00:22:33.080 what we're really optimistic about we\n00:22:34.559 want to give you all some tools for that\n00:22:36.200 I'm not suggesting that you can watch\n00:22:37.799 the guide and transform yourself into\n00:22:39.480 anything that you want to um but you\n00:22:42.039 know I think it's like it's certainly a\n00:22:43.559 big step in the right\n00:22:45.840 direction and uh yeah I guess it's also\n00:22:48.360 like since you know PC Master race over\n00:22:52.799 here I was almost thinking about it like\n00:22:55.640 assembling a PC which is something that\n00:22:57.120 I stopped doing a couple years ago\n00:22:59.559 sag but you know I just couldn't keep up\n00:23:01.799 and instead I decided to for the LA\n00:23:04.120 sometime around 2010 I decided to start\n00:23:07.640 focusing on instead of building PCS\n00:23:09.279 building people and how that works and\n00:23:12.919 that was a lot of fun it's been great\n00:23:14.120 it's been\n00:23:15.080 great okay\n00:23:20.159 um all right so we've got a couple\n00:23:22.840 things to talk about today\n00:23:29.240 okay so we're going to give youall a\n00:23:30.360 choice all right I give you choice I\n00:23:33.520 give Choice\n00:23:35.880 chat we're going to talk about a couple\n00:23:38.640 things today oh that doesn't I don't\n00:23:41.520 like it when this happens where I'm\n00:23:43.240 zooming out and the picture is getting\n00:23:45.200 larger what so weird what what\n00:23:48.480 Shenanigans is this okay the night\n00:23:50.880 before a day off is more satisfying than\n00:23:52.799 the actual day off we're going to talk\n00:23:54.360 about\n00:23:55.480 that um why does this always happen\n00:23:58.919 after a good head clearing walk 5 hours\n00:24:00.679 into the walk my potential knows no\n00:24:02.400 bounds I will accomplish greater Feats\n00:24:04.159 than any man before me I will or woman I\n00:24:06.919 will uncover every last secret of the\n00:24:08.559 universe I will experience every\n00:24:10.080 possible emotion and never die I will\n00:24:11.720 turn my life around the moment I get\n00:24:15.320 home and then 10 minutes after getting\n00:24:17.400 home\n00:24:18.320 damn and the Eternal ADHD Doomer\n00:24:23.520 involuntary switches between an\n00:24:26.000 involuntarily switches between being an\n00:24:28.399 Unstoppable force and an immovable\n00:24:30.919 object writes reminders to himself and\n00:24:33.520 doesn't read them wonders whether he's\n00:24:36.520 the RW lazy or both gets got nothing\n00:24:40.039 done all day still feels overwhelmed and\n00:24:42.000 exhausted can't trust his own judgment\n00:24:43.559 etc etc so we're going to talk about all\n00:24:46.000 three of these this last one we'll get\n00:24:48.360 to if we have time but I want to ask\n00:24:51.520 yall what do you all want to do\n00:24:57.080 first okay looks like a lot of people\n00:24:59.360 want 5H hour\n00:25:00.880 walk\n00:25:05.039 great\n00:25:06.679 okay\n00:25:08.040 [Music]\n00:25:09.240 so five okay we'll get to all three of\n00:25:12.080 them all\n00:25:14.200 right yeah so it's the title uh go over\n00:25:17.600 topics again okay so here are our\n00:25:18.840 choices I'm going to try to make this\n00:25:22.760 poll Dr K attempts\n00:25:25.720 poll you're alive I'm aware I'm aware\n00:25:29.320 that I'm live I figured that out but\n00:25:32.799 thanks for letting me know okay let's do\n00:25:36.360 poll oh\n00:25:39.360 great okay so ADHD Doomer is\n00:25:42.960 winning thank you so much mods for being\n00:25:46.679 there for me when I wasn't there for\n00:25:49.840 myself y'all are the okay great and then\n00:25:52.880 let's\n00:25:55.640 see um How do I\n00:26:01.279 see okay poll is up yeah I see that how\n00:26:05.200 do I see the I I'm seeing number\n00:26:10.159 two so looks like ADHD okay so sounds\n00:26:13.440 like people no surprise people want the\n00:26:15.960 topic\n00:26:17.240 of okay how do I close this poll 1,000\n00:26:22.080 votes I'm going to close the\n00:26:25.640 poll okay poll ended\n00:26:29.279 all right so okay so let's start with\n00:26:32.399 ADHD great let's do it chat we're going\n00:26:34.279 to get to all three of them don't worry\n00:26:35.640 we've got time all right okay so we're\n00:26:39.480 going to talk a little bit\n00:26:41.120 about the Eternal ADHD Doomer okay so\n00:26:46.240 what we're going to actually do today is\n00:26:48.440 go over each of these\n00:26:50.600 features understand why they happen what\n00:26:53.240 the Neuroscience vulnerabilities are\n00:26:55.159 what goes on in ADHD that predisposes us\n00:26:57.679 to this\n00:26:58.960 and the real challenge that we're going\n00:27:00.320 to discover is that one of the biggest\n00:27:02.120 problems with ADHD is not the symptoms\n00:27:05.559 themselves one of the biggest problems\n00:27:07.600 with ADHD is our adaptations to the\n00:27:12.000 systems so sorry the the symptoms so the\n00:27:15.760 one of the biggest problems that I see\n00:27:17.039 in ADHD is that you're living a life\n00:27:19.240 with ADHD and the world is designed for\n00:27:21.240 neurotypical kids they're not designed\n00:27:22.919 for you and what this means is that you\n00:27:25.480 have to develop compensatory strategies\n00:27:28.360 in order to succeed like chugging a\n00:27:30.360 gallon of caffeine before you get\n00:27:32.240 anything done the problem is that the\n00:27:34.960 compensatory strategies that you develop\n00:27:38.279 actually cause problems later in life so\n00:27:41.559 really good example of this is if you\n00:27:43.600 all play games at low rank what you will\n00:27:47.640 discover is that people at low rank do\n00:27:49.880 stupid things and then you ask someone\n00:27:52.919 at low rank why do you do this stupid\n00:27:55.080 thing like the the classic thing that I\n00:27:56.640 tend to see a lot in the multiplayer\n00:27:57.919 game I play is playing a support role\n00:28:01.480 like playing a support character in a\n00:28:03.360 non-support role so you're like because\n00:28:05.919 it in in my rank like you can't play\n00:28:08.360 real support because everyone sucks so\n00:28:11.200 you need to have like a good player to\n00:28:13.600 team up with in order to play this thing\n00:28:16.240 the way it's supposed to be played and\n00:28:18.399 instead what I'm going to do is play in\n00:28:20.360 some way that only works at my low rank\n00:28:23.279 MMR and then what tends to happen in\n00:28:25.720 this situation as you play this weird we\n00:28:28.399 strategy that kind of sometimes works in\n00:28:30.840 your time because you try doing it the\n00:28:32.360 regular way and that doesn't appe appear\n00:28:34.480 to work right that's just like ADHD and\n00:28:36.399 neurotypical I try to do it the\n00:28:38.039 neurotypical way the way that everyone\n00:28:39.679 is says that you're supposed to doesn't\n00:28:41.480 work for me so I have to come up with my\n00:28:43.559 own\n00:28:44.720 adaptation but then what ends up\n00:28:46.600 happening is that you are training\n00:28:48.159 yourself in habits that as you climb\n00:28:52.399 ranks as you improve in life start to\n00:28:54.840 create more problems and so a lot of\n00:28:57.399 what I see in DHD is a lot of unlearning\n00:29:00.360 that has to be done and the biggest\n00:29:02.960 challenge here especially when we look\n00:29:04.559 at a lot of these\n00:29:05.840 adaptations is that sometimes we'll do\n00:29:08.200 things to win a particular game but it\n00:29:10.440 forms the wrong habits in the long term\n00:29:13.159 and if you stop and think for a second\n00:29:16.039 about see anytime you develop a good\n00:29:23.039 habit the development of the good habit\n00:29:26.000 is not an advantage at the very\n00:29:28.960 beginning the development of a good\n00:29:30.880 habit comes at a cost with very little\n00:29:33.480 reward does that make sense so like if I\n00:29:36.679 start exercising regularly the first\n00:29:40.080 three months are going to suck there's\n00:29:42.120 no there's no reward it's just torture\n00:29:44.519 for the first three months the reward\n00:29:46.279 happens later and this fundamental\n00:29:48.919 principle of habit building that it\n00:29:50.720 comes at a cost at the beginning so\n00:29:52.519 another good example is using a\n00:29:54.600 calendar so if I start using a calendar\n00:29:57.600 at the very beginning I'm remembering\n00:29:59.080 everything in my head and using a\n00:30:00.679 calendar doesn't actually benefit me\n00:30:03.159 using a calendar benefits me once I get\n00:30:05.320 into the habit of it so in training good\n00:30:08.039 habits comes at a very high cost at the\n00:30:10.240 beginning and brains with ADHD are\n00:30:12.559 particularly vulnerable to that so let's\n00:30:14.240 take a quick look at why this\n00:30:16.600 happens okay I'm G to mute myself so I\n00:30:19.760 think this is Russell\n00:30:24.440 Barkley how explains to these parents\n00:30:27.360 this child can play video games for\n00:30:29.159 hours and cannot do homework for more\n00:30:31.640 than a few minutes as the video game\n00:30:34.039 provides external continuous 100%\n00:30:37.880 consequences for interacting with it and\n00:30:40.080 the homework does nothing when a problem\n00:30:42.919 is solved on a sheet of paper nothing\n00:30:45.799 happens the consequences are delayed and\n00:30:49.880 therein lies the trouble so the coral\n00:30:52.360 are of this is if you want to see an\n00:30:54.080 ADHD person fail put him in any\n00:30:56.399 environment where there are no\n00:30:57.440 consequences\n00:30:58.559 and I guarantee you failure will not get\n00:31:00.760 done because the person cannot self\n00:31:02.639 motivate and this is not a choice and\n00:31:04.559 this is not willful and this is not a\n00:31:06.880 child who just would if they wished wake\n00:31:08.799 up tomorrow and smell the coffee and get\n00:31:10.399 busy and do the work they cannot this is\n00:31:12.600 an internal neurogenetic executive\n00:31:16.399 failure you can't self-motivate like\n00:31:18.720 other people so it doesn't matter what\n00:31:20.279 your goals are you won't get there\n00:31:21.760 because self motivation is required the\n00:31:24.120 fourth\n00:31:26.360 exe all right so let's let's take a look\n00:31:28.440 at this okay so I think this is a great\n00:31:30.360 take on\n00:31:31.440 ADHD um and I think this principle leans\n00:31:36.360 into a lot of these problems so what\n00:31:38.039 we're actually going to start with is\n00:31:40.320 just like reading each of these out\n00:31:43.600 okay so\n00:31:47.440 involuntarily\n00:31:50.120 switching between Unstoppable Force\n00:31:57.960 and immovable\n00:32:01.000 object okay so we're going to explain\n00:32:02.919 we're going to get into each of these in\n00:32:05.000 detail okay abandons\n00:32:12.240 anything uh that they're not immediately\n00:32:17.919 successful right and so thankfully Dr\n00:32:20.679 Barkley has already explained this St so\n00:32:22.279 we'll we'll see these tired of people\n00:32:24.200 telling him to just try harder even\n00:32:26.360 though he knows they're right\n00:32:30.000 try harder\n00:32:33.799 Noob okay WR reminders to\n00:32:40.960 himself but doesn't read\n00:32:45.559 them so we're going to break each of\n00:32:47.919 these apart\n00:32:49.600 okay um spend weeks preparing for a\n00:32:56.159 task preparing\n00:32:59.000 for small\n00:33:02.200 tasks chugs gallon of\n00:33:08.519 caffeine\n00:33:12.080 okay can't regulate\n00:33:21.360 emotions um wonders whether question\n00:33:26.399 lazy\n00:33:28.360 questions\n00:33:30.679 stupid right uh watch this video on mute\n00:33:33.840 while listening to another all the while\n00:33:35.919 distracted by thoughts so let's say\n00:33:38.480 sensory over\n00:33:43.440 simulation okay um doesn't do anything\n00:33:47.159 no tasks\n00:33:50.639 finished but still\n00:33:52.799 tired\n00:33:56.320 exhausted and then can't trust his own\n00:34:01.679 judgment okay so let's take a look at\n00:34:04.880 these and understand each of them in\n00:34:07.200 turn Okay\n00:34:10.079 so we're going to the\n00:34:12.879 top so let's start with this very simple\n00:34:15.599 one of involuntarily switching between\n00:34:18.119 an Unstoppable force and an immovable\n00:34:21.119 object so a lot of people think that\n00:34:23.359 ADHD is about distraction that I cannot\n00:34:27.079 focus my mind but if we really look at\n00:34:29.599 it what ADHD is a is is a\n00:34:34.079 disorder of\n00:34:37.639 attention Okay now this is important to\n00:34:40.119 understand so when we say this is a\n00:34:42.199 disorder of attention and we cover this\n00:34:44.679 a lot in the guide to ADHD it's a\n00:34:46.359 central feature so disordered attention\n00:34:49.359 means that I'm not in control of my\n00:34:51.719 attention and if we look at the way that\n00:34:54.000 we need to control our attention we need\n00:34:56.320 two fundamental capabilities to control\n00:34:58.880 our attention one is to shift our\n00:35:02.040 attention away from something when we\n00:35:04.680 need to and the second is to shift our\n00:35:07.960 attention towards something when we need\n00:35:10.560 to so this is and it's disorder in both\n00:35:13.240 directions and this is actually what\n00:35:15.160 leads to so much under diagnosis of ADHD\n00:35:18.920 so a lot of parents that I work with\n00:35:20.400 will say okay my kid doesn't have ADHD\n00:35:23.119 he can sit there and play Legos for 5\n00:35:25.880 hours without being disturbed he is\n00:35:28.640 capable or she is capable of focusing\n00:35:31.400 for long periods of time therefore they\n00:35:33.960 do not have ADHD absolutely consistent\n00:35:36.480 with\n00:35:37.280 ADHD so people with ADHD struggle with\n00:35:40.400 hyperfocus which means they're still not\n00:35:42.320 in control of their attention if they\n00:35:44.119 tell their attention hey it's time to\n00:35:46.359 focus on something else they're not able\n00:35:49.160 to do that what people are very familiar\n00:35:51.480 with is the inability to focus on what\n00:35:53.520 you want to so their mind is distracted\n00:35:55.480 in a thousand different places I can't\n00:35:57.079 get it to focus focus on one thing and\n00:35:59.520 the opposite is true where once I focus\n00:36:01.480 on this thing I cannot get it to deviate\n00:36:03.920 my attention\n00:36:05.240 elsewhere this is also why kids with\n00:36:07.960 ADHD get yelled at more and this will\n00:36:11.200 come later as well so what parents will\n00:36:14.079 often times learn is that I require a\n00:36:17.680 larger stimulus to break through their\n00:36:21.119 hyper Focus so you have to yell at your\n00:36:23.599 children to literally get their\n00:36:25.040 attention so this is important to\n00:36:26.800 understand so our brain has this part we\n00:36:29.280 have this part of a brain called the\n00:36:30.440 thalamus and the thalamus integrates all\n00:36:33.599 kinds of sensory information and it\n00:36:36.640 tells us it brings certain sensory\n00:36:38.960 information to our attention so if I'm\n00:36:41.319 like walking down the street and there's\n00:36:43.720 a snake in the\n00:36:45.520 path something even though I'm seeing\n00:36:48.040 Blades of grass and birds and leaves and\n00:36:50.839 sunlight and cars and whatever I'm my\n00:36:53.599 brain is receiving all of this sensory\n00:36:55.520 stimulus but I'm not aware of it\n00:36:58.880 the thalamus comes in because it's\n00:37:00.480 integrating all that information\n00:37:01.920 processing all that information and then\n00:37:03.400 it serves something up to you and it\n00:37:05.680 says hey stop doing what you're doing\n00:37:08.079 because there's a snake here and then we\n00:37:09.520 notice there's a snake and we jump so\n00:37:12.000 this is the healthy way that our brain\n00:37:14.160 should work where there is a normal\n00:37:16.200 balance of being able to break our\n00:37:19.280 attention on one thing and be able to\n00:37:21.800 shift it to something else this is why\n00:37:24.680 people with ADHD feel like they are\n00:37:26.800 alternating\n00:37:28.040 right and you don't get to control it by\n00:37:29.480 the way between an Unstoppable force and\n00:37:32.960 an immovable object so you're able to\n00:37:35.200 hyperfocus on things and there are other\n00:37:37.640 times where it's impossible to get\n00:37:39.280 started and that is because we are not\n00:37:41.560 in control of our motiv our Attention\n00:37:43.920 our attention is way too disregulated it\n00:37:47.720 can hyperfocus in some places and uh\n00:37:50.680 make it impossible to focus in others\n00:37:52.680 okay so that's the first\n00:37:54.599 thing um second thing\n00:37:58.920 all right so abandons anything immediate\n00:38:01.920 unless it's immediately\n00:38:04.160 successful\n00:38:06.040 unless okay so let's take a look at why\n00:38:08.880 this is abandons anything he isn't\n00:38:10.359 immediately good at why is this so Dr\n00:38:12.800 Barkley does a great job of explaining\n00:38:14.760 this so let's understand this we have\n00:38:16.599 this other part of our brain called the\n00:38:18.200 nucleus\n00:38:19.800 succumbent and if you look at people\n00:38:21.720 with ADHD this is where our dopamine\n00:38:24.520 reward circuitry is\n00:38:29.880 and so what happens in the brain of\n00:38:31.359 someone with ADHD is that they are\n00:38:33.280 vulnerable to the nucleus succumbent so\n00:38:35.359 this is important to understand so\n00:38:37.599 here's our nucleus accumbens here are\n00:38:39.599 our frontal loes and generally speaking\n00:38:41.880 there is a tug of war between these two\n00:38:44.440 things so our frontal loes are the part\n00:38:47.160 of our brain that will tell us oh oh\n00:38:49.680 [ __ ] you guys can't see this\n00:38:51.800 whoops I guess it doesn't whoops sorry\n00:38:55.960 oh crap do I need to we do\n00:38:59.200 this hold on\n00:39:03.000 chat\n00:39:05.440 um let me look at this okay so let's\n00:39:08.720 I'll I'll just do this again so that\n00:39:09.880 y'all can see okay so let's go through\n00:39:12.280 each of these\n00:39:13.400 features involuntary switches between an\n00:39:16.000 Unstoppable force and an immovable\n00:39:18.240 object abandons anything he isn't\n00:39:20.520 immediately good at tired of people\n00:39:22.480 telling him to just try harder even\n00:39:24.640 though he knows they're right writes\n00:39:26.440 reminders to himself and doesn't read\n00:39:28.160 them spends weeks mentally preparing for\n00:39:30.480 a task that takes 15 minutes to complete\n00:39:32.960 chugs caffeine by the gallon cannot\n00:39:35.000 regulate his emotions ruled by fear in\n00:39:38.040 feelings of inadequacy wonders whether\n00:39:40.599 he's [ __ ] lazy or both watches a\n00:39:43.200 video on mute while listening to another\n00:39:45.200 all while distracted by his own thoughts\n00:39:47.480 and got nothing done all day still feels\n00:39:50.040 overwhelmed and exhausted and can't\n00:39:51.760 trust his own judgment so you know\n00:39:53.800 what's really funny about this there's a\n00:39:56.400 decent chance I'm on the ADHD Spectrum\n00:39:58.520 in some way and this is like the perfect\n00:40:00.960 example of my attention being so focused\n00:40:04.720 on something that my Thalamus is not\n00:40:08.640 telling me hey you haven't switched your\n00:40:11.480 overlay people can't see what you're\n00:40:13.640 talking about they have no [ __ ] clue\n00:40:15.800 you're in your own world just running\n00:40:18.880 full speed Speed Ahead I become an\n00:40:21.119 Unstoppable force and y'all are not able\n00:40:24.599 to break into my Thalamus and alert me\n00:40:28.280 to the fact that you guys don't know\n00:40:29.800 what I'm talking about right this is\n00:40:31.880 classic ADHD and we see it right here\n00:40:34.960 hilarious I couldn't have planned this\n00:40:36.839 better\n00:40:38.319 okay\n00:40:39.920 so let's kind of go back to this all\n00:40:42.119 right so this is a disorder of\n00:40:44.079 attention now let's go back to abandons\n00:40:47.160 anything unless it's immediately\n00:40:48.440 successful so we have our nucleus\n00:40:50.400 accumbens which is over here this our\n00:40:52.280 dopamine reward circuitry and then we\n00:40:54.920 have our frontal opes so when these two\n00:40:57.640 things interact with each other there's\n00:40:59.560 a tension so the frontal loes are\n00:41:01.400 responsible for something called\n00:41:03.359 executive\n00:41:05.040 function okay hold on a second move this\n00:41:08.200 around a little\n00:41:10.760 bit\n00:41:12.560 okay looks like we lost the X there we\n00:41:15.920 go okay so executive function is the\n00:41:19.440 ability to plan and execute\n00:41:24.280 tasks which usually involves delayed\n00:41:31.160 gratification whereas the nucleus\n00:41:33.520 accumbens is responsible for immediate\n00:41:38.319 gratification so it's like let's say I'm\n00:41:40.480 having a sandwich and someone asks me or\n00:41:43.560 like I'm having a burger and someone\n00:41:45.440 asks me do you want fries and and a\n00:41:47.599 drink with that and so my frontal loes\n00:41:50.480 are like those are unhealthy for me I\n00:41:52.520 should not have those things and my\n00:41:54.040 nucleus accumbens is like hell yeah\n00:41:56.319 let's go so what we tend to find is that\n00:41:59.079 there is a development of these two\n00:42:01.680 parts of our brain the nucleus\n00:42:04.079 succumbent develops very very rapidly\n00:42:06.359 it's very very potent in kids the\n00:42:09.440 frontal loes develop more slowly so they\n00:42:11.880 develop until somewhere between the age\n00:42:13.640 of 25 and\n00:42:15.520 35 some literature will say that the\n00:42:17.920 nucle I mean the executive function kind\n00:42:20.440 of maps a maxes out around 25 that\n00:42:23.760 hasn't been my clinical\n00:42:25.480 experience so there studies about this\n00:42:27.559 that are a little bit dated but I think\n00:42:28.920 we actually mature well into our\n00:42:32.760 30s so game's not over for y'all if\n00:42:35.160 you're like 27 and your frontal loes are\n00:42:37.040 scuffed it's still okay we'll be okay\n00:42:38.800 don't worry about it so what happens in\n00:42:41.559 ADHD is that the balance between these\n00:42:43.960 two things is it's\n00:42:48.160 imbalanced our nucleus accumbent is\n00:42:50.680 relatively speaking stronger than our\n00:42:52.720 frontal loes and this is what Dr Barkley\n00:42:54.599 is talking about so like we need some\n00:42:56.880 kind of immediate gratification in order\n00:42:59.760 to reinforce the behavior and we really\n00:43:02.440 struggle with delayed\n00:43:04.920 gratification now when Dr Barkley says\n00:43:07.440 that this task is impossible that's\n00:43:10.000 where I disagree a little bit so I think\n00:43:12.480 effort is really important to understand\n00:43:14.000 and we'll get to that in a second we\n00:43:16.520 going to talk about try hard or Noob but\n00:43:18.240 this is not hopeless so just to give\n00:43:19.720 youall a couple of different examples\n00:43:21.480 okay so I think it's it's fair to say\n00:43:25.319 that at default this task is very very\n00:43:27.640 difficult for people with ADHD but we\n00:43:29.839 know there are a couple of good points\n00:43:31.400 one is that we know that Psychotherapy\n00:43:33.440 for ADHD is just as effective as\n00:43:35.680 medication we can see vast improvements\n00:43:38.400 in clinical symptoms through the\n00:43:40.000 implementation of psychotherapy and\n00:43:42.079 Psychotherapy for ADHD is a b basically\n00:43:44.440 like brain training it's like training\n00:43:46.760 your brain to adapt to your\n00:43:49.119 circumstances in a healthy way that\n00:43:52.319 allows you to achieve what you want to\n00:43:54.400 achieve without too high of a cost right\n00:43:57.319 so this training is really slow so the\n00:43:59.920 reason that we don't do it automatically\n00:44:01.720 is because we sort of figure out\n00:44:03.520 adaptations and this is the real\n00:44:05.760 challenge with ADHD is the only\n00:44:08.800 adaptations that we're capable of making\n00:44:12.160 are the ones that give us immediate\n00:44:14.359 reward so I want you all to think about\n00:44:16.640 that for a second right this is what's\n00:44:17.880 really crippling about ADHD for people\n00:44:21.520 in life is that you can't make an\n00:44:24.119 adaptation that doesn't work right away\n00:44:26.880 with which is exactly how we get\n00:44:29.079 to things like gallons of chugs of C\n00:44:33.599 caffeine by the gallon because any kind\n00:44:36.079 of habit that will lead to success over\n00:44:40.119 time is not something that your brain\n00:44:42.359 sees the reward from so this is really\n00:44:44.960 important to understand okay so when we\n00:44:48.079 when we do an\n00:44:49.960 action when we anytime we take an action\n00:44:53.079 at some point the action is rewarded\n00:44:56.119 Okay so I'll give you all just a let's\n00:44:58.720 draw this out and understand this this\n00:45:00.400 is the real challenge with\n00:45:04.400 ADHD so let's say I take an action at\n00:45:07.920 time point\n00:45:10.040 t0 and then there is a lag and at time\n00:45:13.200 let's say T1 which is let's say 5\n00:45:17.079 minutes or T2 which is 50\n00:45:22.079 minutes or T3 which is 5 days\n00:45:28.520 so if we look at something like\n00:45:31.280 exercising what we find is that the\n00:45:33.400 action takes place over here but the\n00:45:36.240 reward may be over\n00:45:38.240 here and so our nucleus accumbens looks\n00:45:41.119 at the consequences of our actions and\n00:45:43.680 then if the reward is over here it will\n00:45:45.319 go back and reinforce this action the\n00:45:48.160 problem with ADHD is that these two\n00:45:50.720 things are not available to\n00:45:53.480 us because of the way that our nucleus\n00:45:55.760 succumbent Works unless unless it gives\n00:45:57.520 us an instant benefit we cannot\n00:46:00.480 reinforce that\n00:46:02.440 behavior so I was working a video game\n00:46:05.880 company asked for my help and they said\n00:46:09.400 Dr K can you help us make a more\n00:46:12.200 positive\n00:46:13.720 community and I said\n00:46:17.000 sure and so then I asked them how do\n00:46:19.359 yall address toxicity and they say that\n00:46:22.480 okay we have this reporting system and\n00:46:25.119 the reporting system happens and then\n00:46:26.920 someone files a report and then it goes\n00:46:29.400 through this process and then we take\n00:46:31.720 action on the report I said what's the\n00:46:33.280 amount of time between the action and\n00:46:36.319 the the the the mistake or the thing\n00:46:39.680 that the the toxic behavior that the\n00:46:41.160 player makes and the consequence from\n00:46:42.760 that behavior what's the time lag in\n00:46:45.520 that space and they're like somewhere\n00:46:47.040 between two weeks and two\n00:46:49.480 months and I was like this is never\n00:46:51.440 going to work so I want youall to think\n00:46:53.319 about this for a second let's say I play\n00:46:55.680 a video game today I you up for a game\n00:46:58.000 and I'm a toxic\n00:47:00.160 [ __ ] and then sometime randomly like\n00:47:03.319 52 days later I log into my account one\n00:47:07.839 day ban banned [ __ ] what do you think\n00:47:11.839 my reaction is going to\n00:47:14.079 be do you think I'm going to learn from\n00:47:16.240 my\n00:47:17.520 mistakes what do you think is going to\n00:47:19.160 happen to my toxicity you think I'm\n00:47:21.319 going to be better I'm going to be like\n00:47:22.559 oh my God I made this mistake oh a pool\n00:47:25.280 of my teammates oh my God my with your\n00:47:27.119 teammates I hurt their feelings oh no I\n00:47:29.680 hurt their feelings I need to be a\n00:47:31.000 better person I be a nicer person yeah\n00:47:33.720 i' be better i' be nicer I no longer be\n00:47:35.720 toxic no\n00:47:38.160 no no doesn't work like that imagine if\n00:47:40.920 you're potty training your dog and your\n00:47:42.240 dog pisses the bed and you come back 48\n00:47:45.079 days later and you're like bad dog the\n00:47:47.680 dog is\n00:47:48.680 like what\n00:47:51.240 what this is the problem with ADHD we\n00:47:54.440 need immediate consequences this is is\n00:47:57.160 why people with ADHD and the reason we\n00:47:59.200 need immediate consequence is because of\n00:48:00.480 the brain the way the brain is wired so\n00:48:02.359 we are so sensitive to this dopamine\n00:48:04.480 circuitry and dopamine doesn't get\n00:48:06.359 delayed reward it's not like when you\n00:48:08.240 have an epic game and you win you're\n00:48:10.400 like oh my God the team is winning we're\n00:48:12.319 going to lose then you make some last\n00:48:14.240 minute comeback and you win it's not you\n00:48:16.880 like you wake up 28 Days Later and\n00:48:19.000 you're just like wow that game was so\n00:48:21.079 much fun oh my God Rush of dopamine\n00:48:22.920 randomly 28 Days Later it's not how it\n00:48:24.640 works there's a Time\n00:48:27.280 binding there's a temporal binding\n00:48:29.400 between the action being taken and the\n00:48:31.079 reward being given and people with ADHD\n00:48:33.520 are more sensitive to that temporal\n00:48:35.800 binding which means that they need\n00:48:37.720 immediate\n00:48:38.960 rewards which in turn means that they\n00:48:41.359 are not capable of implementing\n00:48:44.480 long-term plans that will benefit their\n00:48:47.319 lives without help because every single\n00:48:49.880 step requires a dopaminergic reward\n00:48:52.559 that's why it's impossible for them to\n00:48:53.960 do homework that's why it's impossible\n00:48:55.640 for them to study because all they see\n00:48:57.559 is the effort and they do not see a\n00:49:01.280 reward\n00:49:02.880 okay\n00:49:06.920 so let me think do I want to include\n00:49:09.520 anything else does this make\n00:49:17.160 sense so I'm going to just talk about\n00:49:19.280 habit formation again so this is why\n00:49:21.200 people with ADHD so the real challenge\n00:49:23.480 this is what's so frustrating about\n00:49:25.559 ADHD the the one part of the brain not\n00:49:27.880 the one but one of the parts of the\n00:49:29.160 brain that is actually unaffected by\n00:49:31.880 ADHD is habit circuitry so people with\n00:49:35.000 ADHD are generally speaking capable of\n00:49:37.400 forming habits so this is a completely\n00:49:40.319 different part of the brain it's the\n00:49:41.880 endoc canabo system this is how we form\n00:49:45.040 habits the problem is that even though\n00:49:47.920 that circuitry is\n00:49:49.880 intact the way in which we form habits\n00:49:52.960 involves the nucleus accumbent does that\n00:49:54.680 kind of make sense I don't know if you\n00:49:55.680 all understand the difference between\n00:49:57.000 the two so once it a habit is laid down\n00:50:00.960 the Habit is just as accessible to\n00:50:03.000 someone who has\n00:50:04.559 ADHD but the laying down of the Habit is\n00:50:07.960 almost impossible because in order for\n00:50:10.240 the Habit to be laying down we need an\n00:50:12.240 immediate reward so what do we end up\n00:50:14.960 seeing this is why people with ADHD get\n00:50:17.119 stuck in video games and other forms of\n00:50:19.400 addictive substances because their\n00:50:21.200 capability of forming a habit their\n00:50:24.040 ability to pour concrete is their\n00:50:27.240 concrete solidifies just as well as a\n00:50:29.960 neurotypical persons the problem is the\n00:50:32.480 way in which they can pour concrete is\n00:50:34.880 dictated by their dopam energic system\n00:50:37.680 so the only time I will pour concrete is\n00:50:40.200 if I get an immediate reward so their\n00:50:42.480 habit capability is normal but the\n00:50:45.640 habits that they are capable of forming\n00:50:48.839 are very restricted to dopaminergic\n00:50:51.119 reinforcement which is why they get so\n00:50:52.880 addicted to video games because as you\n00:50:55.240 play a video game day after day after\n00:50:56.680 after day after day after day you're\n00:50:58.119 pouring concrete pouring concrete\n00:50:59.640 pouring concrete but you only get to\n00:51:01.880 pour concrete in this one\n00:51:04.319 place all of the other attempts to pour\n00:51:06.799 concrete to make walkways driveways\n00:51:09.440 freeways that doesn't work the only\n00:51:11.720 thing we can do is fill up our toilet\n00:51:13.400 and fill up our sink with concrete and\n00:51:15.440 this is what happens with people with\n00:51:17.040 ADHD they get addicted to games very\n00:51:20.400 easily there's vulnerability to the\n00:51:22.720 nucleus accumbens and dopamine that is\n00:51:24.720 absolutely there but it's so much more\n00:51:26.119 complicated in that this is what's\n00:51:27.520 beautiful about the science of ADHD we\n00:51:29.319 learn we know so much more okay so it's\n00:51:32.880 you can form habits\n00:51:34.920 but which habits you are formed are\n00:51:37.599 controlled by the dopaminergic reward so\n00:51:40.559 if you get an immediate reward then that\n00:51:42.559 will become habitual for you very easily\n00:51:45.880 okay so let's move on\n00:51:51.559 next so this is why we abandon anything\n00:51:54.480 that you're not immediately good at\n00:51:55.680 because there's no immed Med dope\n00:51:56.960 anderic reward which means that we\n00:51:58.520 cannot engage in the behavior again\n00:52:00.839 tired of people telling him to just try\n00:52:02.799 harder even though he knows they're\n00:52:04.480 right so this is a huge problem okay\n00:52:06.960 we've talked about this quite a bit we\n00:52:08.520 made a whole video about ADHD and\n00:52:10.760 depression which yall should definitely\n00:52:12.680 check out this is a huge part of Dr K's\n00:52:15.280 guide to ADHD as\n00:52:17.200 well so there's this idea in ADHD that\n00:52:21.880 more effort will yield better returns\n00:52:26.240 and so so what often times happens in\n00:52:27.920 ADHD is we see a\n00:52:30.160 misdiagnosis because people notice oh\n00:52:32.760 this person is capable of focusing this\n00:52:34.680 person is intelligent and if they are\n00:52:37.200 intelligent and capable and the behavior\n00:52:39.880 doesn't happen what's missing lazy\n00:52:43.040 there's a lack of effort so you need to\n00:52:44.599 put forth more effort this is\n00:52:47.599 incorrect effort doesn't work if you do\n00:52:50.119 not have the tools necessary this is\n00:52:52.640 like telling someone who's missing a leg\n00:52:55.359 if you try hard\n00:52:57.119 you should be able to\n00:52:59.240 walk right the difference between\n00:53:01.760 someone who's missing a leg and someone\n00:53:03.400 who has ADHD is the missing leg is\n00:53:06.559 visible to everybody else but the ADHD\n00:53:10.440 deficit is in your brain it's not\n00:53:12.520 visible to anyone in fact they see\n00:53:15.119 particular things that make you think\n00:53:16.599 that you're neurotypical like IQ they\n00:53:19.000 recognize that you're not\n00:53:21.040 stupid but you don't have the\n00:53:23.920 tools necessary for the effort to\n00:53:28.520 suffuse right so if we think about\n00:53:30.440 effort effort is energy it's like\n00:53:32.760 electricity but electricity requires a\n00:53:35.960 circuit board to go through to manifest\n00:53:39.960 something so what happens is everyone is\n00:53:42.319 looking at your house and they're saying\n00:53:44.599 there's no lights on inside you need\n00:53:47.599 more electricity but you have plenty of\n00:53:50.000 electricity there's no light bulb so you\n00:53:52.319 can have all the electricity in the\n00:53:53.920 world but if there is nothing for the\n00:53:56.160 elect electricity to flow through you\n00:53:57.839 will not get the result so this is the\n00:54:00.799 problem in ADHD it's not a lack of\n00:54:03.079 effort then what happens is everyone\n00:54:05.480 doesn't see this right they don't\n00:54:07.119 understand that you don't have light\n00:54:08.280 bulbs so they say you need to jack up\n00:54:10.640 the electricity jack up the electricity\n00:54:12.240 jack up the electricity and so then you\n00:54:14.480 end up doing that but you can jack up\n00:54:16.440 the electricity as much as you want to\n00:54:17.920 but if there's no light bulb there's\n00:54:19.040 going to be no light and this is where\n00:54:21.160 we get to a lot of these other\n00:54:23.640 manifestations okay gets nothing done\n00:54:26.440 all day still feels overwhelmed and\n00:54:28.760 exhausted wonders whether he's [ __ ]\n00:54:31.319 lazy or both these are all parts of the\n00:54:33.599 same thing so then what happens is when\n00:54:36.680 we recognize I'm putting in a lot of\n00:54:38.599 effort and you feel exhausted imagine\n00:54:42.000 for a second what the conclusion is so\n00:54:44.799 if I'm pumping in effort right and this\n00:54:48.319 is another great example right here\n00:54:51.319 spends weeks mentally preparing for a\n00:54:53.319 task that takes 15 minutes to complete\n00:54:55.839 so when I look at other humans who are\n00:54:57.799 capable of finishing a 15-minute task in\n00:54:59.839 15 minutes and it takes me weeks and\n00:55:02.640 tons of effort and everyone is telling\n00:55:04.400 me to put in lots of effort just think\n00:55:06.119 about this equation for a\n00:55:08.079 second what is the only logical\n00:55:11.000 conclusion is that I'm messed up in some\n00:55:13.119 way I'm\n00:55:15.160 cursed I'm defective right because I'm\n00:55:18.240 putting in so much effort I'm so\n00:55:20.240 exhausted at the end of the day it's so\n00:55:21.880 easy for everybody else and it makes\n00:55:24.640 sense right because if you're putting in\n00:55:27.520 all this effort and you're not able to\n00:55:29.200 do things and it's so hard for you to do\n00:55:31.240 ordinary stuff then the only conclusion\n00:55:34.440 is you're just as smart as they are so\n00:55:36.319 you must be lazy you must be dumb in\n00:55:38.400 some way you must be busted in some way\n00:55:40.760 this is the conclusion that people have\n00:55:43.319 and if you look at studies of comorbid\n00:55:45.599 populations from ADHD and\n00:55:48.359 depression people who are diagnosed with\n00:55:50.880 depression have a 3% chance to develop\n00:55:54.000 ADHD later in life\n00:55:56.920 but if you are diagnosed with ADHD you\n00:55:58.880 have a 70% chance of developing\n00:56:01.280 depression later in life\n00:56:03.520 why it's because of this it's because\n00:56:06.480 you look at the world you assume that\n00:56:08.359 you're neurotypical you put in lots of\n00:56:10.839 effort you try as hard as you can and\n00:56:13.039 you are unable to gain the result and so\n00:56:15.480 the only possibility I don't know if\n00:56:17.520 this kind of makes\n00:56:19.760 sense right so like if I look\n00:56:23.760 at here's me or let's say here's a\n00:56:26.799 normal person here's a neurotypical\n00:56:29.359 person they put in 10 units of\n00:56:32.160 effort and they get 10 units of\n00:56:36.400 reward but if you have\n00:56:40.480 ADHD you put in 10 units of effort and\n00:56:44.079 you get one unit of\n00:56:47.440 reward so what's the only way that you\n00:56:50.039 can\n00:56:51.400 oh hold on okay so if you're\n00:56:54.880 neurotypical\n00:56:56.480 10 units of effort gets 10 units of\n00:56:58.240 reward and if you have ADHD 10 units of\n00:57:00.440 effort gets one unit of reward what's\n00:57:02.400 the only way to make this equation work\n00:57:05.960 you need a minus 9 over here of some\n00:57:08.720 kind doesn't matter I don't know if I'm\n00:57:11.079 lazy I don't know if I'm pathetic it's\n00:57:13.799 some kind of negative\n00:57:15.920 quality right it's the only way to make\n00:57:18.000 it work and this is their observation\n00:57:19.920 their brain their ability to calculate\n00:57:22.240 is completely\n00:57:24.280 intact right so they they understand\n00:57:26.799 this people with ADHD get this and this\n00:57:28.599 is what ends up leading to things like\n00:57:30.400 self-esteem\n00:57:31.799 problems because what other explanation\n00:57:34.559 is there because people with it's it's\n00:57:37.280 really sad kids with ADHD have a very\n00:57:39.960 good intuitive sense of their IQ the PE\n00:57:43.119 the adults around them have a very good\n00:57:44.799 intuitive sense of their IQ we're very\n00:57:46.839 good as human beings of being able to\n00:57:48.480 tell like who is in the bottom cortile\n00:57:51.280 of IQ who is in the top cortile of IQ\n00:57:54.280 and like who's in the middle like we're\n00:57:56.680 not great at detecting like let's say\n00:57:58.400 130 versus 140 or 140 versus 150 or 70\n00:58:03.119 versus 80 or things like that but we can\n00:58:05.319 tell if you're above aund like\n00:58:06.640 significantly above 100 around 100 or\n00:58:09.319 below 100 and the real tragedy of people\n00:58:11.680 with ADHD is that they know that they're\n00:58:13.440 like just as smart as the kids around\n00:58:15.000 them which means that there must be\n00:58:16.160 something else wrong because the effort\n00:58:18.440 that they put in does not yield a normal\n00:58:20.920 amount of\n00:58:22.400 reward\n00:58:23.920 Okay so\n00:58:26.680 this\n00:58:28.400 principle then what we conclude is that\n00:58:31.559 people should just try harder right it's\n00:58:34.280 a lack of effort and then something even\n00:58:37.359 more damning happens is that if it's a\n00:58:39.400 lack of effort and it doesn't work then\n00:58:42.240 you conclude that you are\n00:58:44.799 lazy so then you make this conclusion\n00:58:47.400 that you are lazy this becomes a truth\n00:58:49.559 for you this becomes part of who you are\n00:58:52.119 this becomes a part of your\n00:58:53.880 identity and then the moment that this\n00:58:55.799 becomes a part of your identity it\n00:58:57.559 becomes a self-fulfilling\n00:58:59.559 prophecy so one of the really\n00:59:01.280 interesting things so I was working with\n00:59:03.200 um this is back when I was in residency\n00:59:05.079 so I was working with a lot of kids who\n00:59:07.319 were\n00:59:09.319 delinquents and the crazy thing is that\n00:59:11.480 a kid will become what you expect of\n00:59:16.000 them most of the time so if you look at\n00:59:19.000 a kid and you decide and it's so sad\n00:59:21.000 because we see this all the time in our\n00:59:22.839 community kids who grow up and y'all are\n00:59:25.520 treated from a young age as losers or\n00:59:28.520 pathetic or your parents tell you that\n00:59:30.039 you're not going to mount to anything or\n00:59:31.480 anything like that and then you will\n00:59:33.000 live up to expectations because that's\n00:59:34.760 what kids do it's like peer pressure\n00:59:36.680 everyone wants to wear these shoes you\n00:59:38.079 want to wear these shoes too except\n00:59:39.720 there's no material component people\n00:59:41.880 will become what you expect of them\n00:59:44.760 because that's what Humans Do Right\n00:59:46.680 everyone else is crying I'll cry too\n00:59:48.599 okay fine everyone else is laughing I'll\n00:59:51.000 laugh\n00:59:51.960 too so the moment that people start\n00:59:54.440 treating a child as lazy the child child\n00:59:56.240 will become lazy because the child is\n00:59:57.599 being told hey I'm lazy hey I'm lazy and\n00:59:59.359 the child understands it too they get it\n01:00:00.799 they're like oh all these other people\n01:00:01.920 are capable of doing this stuff I'm not\n01:00:03.440 capable of doing this stuff and the\n01:00:04.440 world around is telling me that there is\n01:00:05.880 a word for this that word is lazy it's\n01:00:08.480 not\n01:00:09.839 neurodiverse because ADHD is both the\n01:00:12.359 most overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed\n01:00:15.400 psychiatric diagnosis in my opinion what\n01:00:18.160 this means is a lot of people who don't\n01:00:19.680 have it get diagnosed with it and a lot\n01:00:21.760 of people who do have it don't get\n01:00:23.440 diagnosed with it\n01:00:26.079 especially bad for girls by the way so\n01:00:28.200 the rate of diagnosis is really\n01:00:30.200 fascinating rate of diagnosis of girls\n01:00:32.920 to boys to ADHD is 1 to three so for\n01:00:36.039 every three boys that is diagnosed with\n01:00:38.400 ADHD girls are one girl is diagnosed but\n01:00:41.720 if you look at the rates of diagnosis\n01:00:43.280 amongst men in women it's one to one so\n01:00:46.599 we're missing a ton of diagnosis in\n01:00:49.119 young girls why because girls are not as\n01:00:52.400 hyperactive girls are not as disruptive\n01:00:56.280 girls are much more internalizing girls\n01:00:58.839 have so much more external pressure to\n01:01:01.039 be good little girls and don't make a\n01:01:03.119 disturbance whereas boys are\n01:01:05.359 rambunctious so there's a lot of\n01:01:07.160 cultural component there too gender\n01:01:09.240 societal dynamics that play as\n01:01:11.599 well but the key thing to keep in mind\n01:01:14.079 is that if you treat a child like\n01:01:15.520 they're lazy if you tell them they're\n01:01:16.880 lazy if you tell them you just need to\n01:01:18.760 work harder I was told that every single\n01:01:21.240 teacher conference that I had every\n01:01:24.160 single one I'm not talking that's not\n01:01:25.520 even EX exaggeration literally every\n01:01:27.400 single one when I was in school the\n01:01:29.599 teacher would say the same thing every\n01:01:31.280 [ __ ] time your son is so smart if he\n01:01:35.319 just applied himself he would do so much\n01:01:37.960 better if he just worked harder so I\n01:01:42.079 remember my piano teacher told me the\n01:01:43.960 same thing which is that if he practiced\n01:01:47.400 he'd be great and so then what would\n01:01:49.599 happen my parents would turn to me and\n01:01:51.279 they'd say you need to practice more and\n01:01:53.359 I'd say okay Mommy Daddy I will practice\n01:01:56.240 but I did not know how to restrain my\n01:01:59.880 attention practicing felt so\n01:02:03.039 boring because when you practice you\n01:02:05.400 don't actually make music you make noise\n01:02:09.839 there's no reward and so it's impossible\n01:02:13.079 for me to\n01:02:14.680 practice what could I practice Street\n01:02:17.960 Fighter\n01:02:20.039 2 that's easy to practice [ __ ] a I\n01:02:22.799 can practice that [ __ ] all day long\n01:02:26.599 I remember there was one day where I\n01:02:29.079 spent four hours practicing how to do a\n01:02:31.760 Shore yuken for those of Y all that are\n01:02:34.160 familiar with Street Fighter 2 it used\n01:02:36.200 to be now it's easy but back in the day\n01:02:38.200 it used to be a very hard physical\n01:02:40.160 combination to pull off it's forward\n01:02:43.000 down down right diagonally and then you\n01:02:46.279 take your pick and I practiced for four\n01:02:48.480 hours and at the beginning of the day I\n01:02:50.599 didn't know how to do a short you and by\n01:02:51.960 the end I could do it with 99%\n01:02:54.839 proficiency because each time you do a\n01:02:57.200 Shore yukin you hear that super manly sh\n01:03:00.200 yukin I was like [ __ ] yeah let's go son\n01:03:03.119 yeah right it's such a powerful it's\n01:03:05.319 like oh my God my [ __ ] character is\n01:03:06.880 like flying into the air with his fist\n01:03:09.160 in the air whereas if I try to practice\n01:03:11.799 piano what\n01:03:13.520 happens nothing it's just torture it's\n01:03:16.319 torture there's no benefit no Advantage\n01:03:18.640 none\n01:03:20.160 whatsoever this is what happens in ADHD\n01:03:23.839 it is impossible to do something unless\n01:03:25.760 unless there is an immediate reward\n01:03:27.119 without help that is we'll get to it's\n01:03:29.079 not you're not screwed for life okay so\n01:03:32.319 let's move\n01:03:34.279 on\n01:03:35.960 okay\n01:03:38.000 so um we'll get to this in a second\n01:03:40.960 spends weeks preparing for small tasks\n01:03:43.039 this goes to this okay so\n01:03:46.920 now this we kind of\n01:03:50.920 did this we kind of\n01:03:54.160 did so let's talk about a couple\n01:03:57.599 others\n01:04:00.559 okay so writes reminders and doesn't\n01:04:03.559 read\n01:04:04.760 them so this is where we get to actually\n01:04:07.760 like treatment and options for\n01:04:12.000 ADHD see what happens when we have\n01:04:14.760 ADHD is that we look at the rest of the\n01:04:17.079 world and we try to think like we look\n01:04:19.359 at what other people are doing and we\n01:04:21.760 try to implement those Solutions so the\n01:04:24.039 person with ADHD this is the sequence of\n01:04:26.240 events okay the first thing is the\n01:04:27.960 person with ADHD realizes that they have\n01:04:29.920 a bad memory they\n01:04:32.279 forget and so what they say is they say\n01:04:34.520 okay I'll write myself a\n01:04:37.240 reminder and that'll help me remember\n01:04:40.119 but there are a couple of problems with\n01:04:41.559 this the first is that you have to\n01:04:43.839 remember to read your\n01:04:46.559 reminders and they're they don't do that\n01:04:49.039 so they can write reminders is very easy\n01:04:51.200 they're like oh I'll like remember to\n01:04:52.520 read this later but then they don't\n01:04:53.960 actually read the reminder they need a\n01:04:55.720 reminder for the\n01:04:57.599 reminder second thing is that the\n01:04:59.760 writing of a reminder let's understand\n01:05:01.960 this when you write a reminder what is\n01:05:04.480 reinforced absolutely nothing there's no\n01:05:06.720 dopaminergic reinforcement when you\n01:05:08.440 write the reminder the value of the\n01:05:10.839 reminder is in the future delayed\n01:05:13.839 gratification T3 which is 5 days later\n01:05:17.319 you have this reminder which you've\n01:05:18.680 forgotten there's no thing so no\n01:05:20.440 reinforcement doesn't work works for\n01:05:22.200 neurotypical people because they are\n01:05:23.760 capable of remembering the reminder\n01:05:26.520 and when you remember the reminder and\n01:05:28.480 you look at the reminder then you have\n01:05:30.720 you take the action you get the reward\n01:05:33.039 but the reward is 5 days later than when\n01:05:36.640 you wrote the reminder so the the\n01:05:38.680 doesn't get reinforced does this make\n01:05:40.079 sense this is crazy it's a beautiful\n01:05:43.279 example of all the things that go wrong\n01:05:45.160 in\n01:05:46.359 ADHD there's no immediate re\n01:05:48.559 reinforcement you have to remember to\n01:05:50.319 read the reminder which you can't do\n01:05:53.279 right cuz memory is a problem in the\n01:05:54.520 first place we'll get to that in a\n01:05:55.440 second\n01:05:56.839 so no\n01:05:57.839 reinforcement difficulty\n01:06:00.559 remembering third thing is we can't form\n01:06:03.039 the Habit because we're not\n01:06:04.880 consistent so this is why writing\n01:06:06.799 reminders for people with ADHD is a\n01:06:09.400 beautiful solution that works incredibly\n01:06:13.119 well if you have the scaffolding to do\n01:06:16.880 it so let's understand this this is\n01:06:19.039 where treatment of ADHD comes in so what\n01:06:20.760 is psychotherapy for ADHD it is a set of\n01:06:24.240 cognitive skills that are trained in\n01:06:28.599 people that so that you have this\n01:06:31.079 scaffolding to lay down the habit and\n01:06:33.319 once you have the system in place then\n01:06:36.319 it yields a lot of benefit see this is\n01:06:39.039 very important to\n01:06:40.680 understand building a habit for someone\n01:06:43.160 like with ADHD is like digging a well\n01:06:45.640 for\n01:06:46.960 water the first 9 ft you dig is effort\n01:06:50.920 with no reward the 10th foot and you\n01:06:53.559 suddenly have a ton of water you have as\n01:06:55.880 much water as you want to the last foot\n01:06:58.880 is worth infinite water the first 9 ft\n01:07:02.319 are worth Zero Water this is what\n01:07:04.880 building a habit is like this is why\n01:07:06.480 it's hard so if you can get to that\n01:07:09.240 point of having a system that gives you\n01:07:12.000 reminders using a calendar and a lot of\n01:07:14.520 people that I've worked with with ADHD\n01:07:16.160 do this right so they by by hook or by\n01:07:18.920 crook with a ton of effort sometimes\n01:07:20.400 they're lucky enough to develop some\n01:07:21.839 kind of habit that really works for them\n01:07:23.720 some kind of external organizational\n01:07:25.319 system system that really works for them\n01:07:27.160 the problem is that most of us are\n01:07:28.839 capable of digging a 10-ft well and\n01:07:31.000 we're okay waiting for the water with\n01:07:33.039 ADHD you'll dig one foot over here\n01:07:35.480 you'll move away you'll dig two feet\n01:07:37.920 over there you'll dig three feet in\n01:07:39.680 another place so what's happening you're\n01:07:41.799 expending a ton of effort you're\n01:07:43.680 actually digging 40 ft but not in one\n01:07:47.319 place so this is how we get to\n01:07:50.760 this right we've kind of talked about\n01:07:52.720 this already\n01:07:53.799 but gets nothing done all day and still\n01:07:57.039 still feels overwhelmed and exhausted so\n01:07:59.079 let's talk about this for a\n01:08:00.880 second gets nothing done and still feels\n01:08:04.400 overwhelmed and\n01:08:07.400 exhausted what exhausts you what\n01:08:10.720 exhausts you is effort and if you pay\n01:08:13.079 attention to someone who has ADHD they\n01:08:15.440 may get nothing done but it isn't that\n01:08:18.319 they're not doing anything all day in\n01:08:20.479 fact quite the opposite what happens\n01:08:22.679 with someone with ADHD is they are\n01:08:24.198 wrestling with their mind all day\n01:08:28.439 long this is what they're doing and\n01:08:31.439 wrestling with your mind the exertion of\n01:08:33.920 willpower is one of the things that is\n01:08:36.158 very cognitively\n01:08:38.279 draining so they're actually digging 40\n01:08:41.479 feet of Wells just on a dozen different\n01:08:44.040 tasks right and this is what the\n01:08:45.719 experience of someone with ADHD is you\n01:08:47.479 have so much stuff to do everything\n01:08:49.600 needs to get done because you're so\n01:08:51.198 behind so I got to do this and I got to\n01:08:53.040 do this and I got to do this and I got\n01:08:54.679 to do this and oh no I started this but\n01:08:56.520 I forgot about this and now I need to go\n01:08:57.960 grocery shopping now I need to do this\n01:08:59.319 and now I need to check the mail so\n01:09:00.679 you're actually spending a ton of\n01:09:03.399 effort but nothing gets\n01:09:06.479 finished and then every time you switch\n01:09:09.600 tasks there is a warming up to the task\n01:09:12.839 again so like you can't pick it up\n01:09:15.359 exactly where you left off because your\n01:09:17.238 memory isn't very good so you don't\n01:09:19.560 remember what part of this have I done\n01:09:21.158 and what part of this have I not done I\n01:09:23.319 need to like takes takes me a day or two\n01:09:25.000 to like get back into it like what what\n01:09:27.439 do I need to do again cuz you forgot to\n01:09:29.799 do it so this is the experience of\n01:09:32.399 people with ADH it's very very\n01:09:35.600 challenging right and you continue to\n01:09:37.640 get judged because people don't judge\n01:09:39.640 the effort that you put in this is the\n01:09:42.000 big irony if you've got ADHD chances are\n01:09:44.560 you're working the hardest out of any of\n01:09:46.719 your\n01:09:47.839 peers but that's not what you get judged\n01:09:50.040 for you get judged for what gets\n01:09:52.080 complete not how how hard you work and\n01:09:55.640 this is what's so damaging to people see\n01:09:58.199 if someone is doing everything and they\n01:10:00.040 get judged for the\n01:10:01.560 opposite this really [ __ ] people up so\n01:10:04.360 if you're actually working really hard\n01:10:05.960 and people call you lazy that\n01:10:08.239 discordance is so psychologically\n01:10:10.880 damaging if you're actually a good\n01:10:13.080 person so I see this a lot in trauma\n01:10:15.600 there's like a kid who's like a good kid\n01:10:17.880 but their parents teach them that they\n01:10:19.760 are a bad\n01:10:21.080 kid so we'll see this a lot with things\n01:10:23.480 like you know hyper religiosity and\n01:10:25.520 sexuality and and some of these things\n01:10:27.199 where like you know people are taught\n01:10:29.159 that they are bad even though they're\n01:10:31.320 good and this really messes people up\n01:10:34.040 because now Up Is Down and Down is up\n01:10:36.120 it's very hard to go through life when\n01:10:38.199 Up Is Down and Down is\n01:10:39.880 up so the big irony is kids with ADHD\n01:10:43.719 work way harder that's why everything is\n01:10:45.640 so\n01:10:47.239 exhausting but they're taught that\n01:10:49.000 they're\n01:10:50.600 lazy and so now if you've defined hard\n01:10:54.280 work as lazy what chance do you possibly\n01:10:59.000 have\n01:11:02.480 screwed\n01:11:05.239 okay\n01:11:08.120 so let's take a look at a couple of\n01:11:10.239 other\n01:11:12.280 things so chugs gallon of caffeine so\n01:11:15.320 this makes sense okay because chugging a\n01:11:19.360 gallon of caffeine or any other kind of\n01:11:21.480 psychoactive\n01:11:23.120 substance results in such immediate\n01:11:29.719 effect we become dependent on it so\n01:11:33.400 exercising taking a walk in the morning\n01:11:35.480 that has these things have lingering\n01:11:37.239 effects even eating a proper breakfast\n01:11:39.800 has such a slow onset of action that the\n01:11:42.360 behavior doesn't get reinforced chugging\n01:11:44.600 a gallon of caffeine and by the way like\n01:11:46.440 drug companies understand this very well\n01:11:48.840 because this is why they make stimulant\n01:11:50.520 medication so that's really fascinating\n01:11:52.600 so if you look at the studies on\n01:11:54.159 stimulant versus non non stimulant\n01:11:55.960 medication we've got medications like\n01:11:58.120 buproprion or atomoxetine and then we\n01:12:00.760 have medications like methylphenidate\n01:12:03.440 and um amphetamine salts so some are\n01:12:07.040 stimulants and some are not stimulants\n01:12:09.480 if you look at the outcomes on\n01:12:10.920 medication so if I give people\n01:12:12.520 non-stimulant medication and stimul or\n01:12:15.040 stimulant medication they tend to do\n01:12:16.920 just as well in life the outcomes are\n01:12:18.960 the\n01:12:20.120 same why do people love stimulants if\n01:12:22.800 they've got ADHD because they feel the\n01:12:25.560 effect immediately and since they can\n01:12:28.400 notice an immediate difference there's a\n01:12:31.159 lot more reinforcement of that\n01:12:32.960 medication and drug companies understand\n01:12:34.719 this very\n01:12:36.080 well right so what they try to do is\n01:12:38.199 they try to give you something that\n01:12:39.840 subjectively makes you feel better same\n01:12:42.639 difference with benzo aines and\n01:12:44.520 anti-anxiety medications like ssris or\n01:12:47.360 snris so benzo aines activate the same\n01:12:51.040 receptor as alcohol Gaba receptor they\n01:12:53.280 have an immediate effect which makes\n01:12:55.520 them more addictive and patients really\n01:12:57.199 want it the SSRI or snri yields the same\n01:13:01.040 clinical benefit over the course of 2\n01:13:03.320 months but people don't feel it\n01:13:05.320 subjectively as\n01:13:07.719 much so this is very important to\n01:13:10.120 understand so the more immediate the\n01:13:12.000 benefit is the easier it is to reinforce\n01:13:14.120 an\n01:13:15.560 ADHD okay\n01:13:18.760 now let's talk about\n01:13:23.480 this can't regulate\n01:13:25.800 motions so this is another thing to\n01:13:28.639 understand so in ADHD there's a let me\n01:13:31.480 see if I can find\n01:13:43.080 this\n01:13:46.120 um\n01:13:49.199 so let's just I'll just show you all so\n01:13:51.639 there's a bunch of papers on this but we\n01:13:53.080 can just look at it here\n01:13:56.719 reject optional cookies [ __ ] no cookies\n01:13:58.800 dude kidding so is emotional\n01:14:00.880 disregulation part of the\n01:14:01.960 Psychopathology of ADHD in\n01:14:04.320 adults\n01:14:06.719 um so empirical studies attest this\n01:14:09.639 Dimension sufficient this Dimension\n01:14:12.159 sufficient reliability and validity\n01:14:14.280 symptoms of emotional disregulation are\n01:14:16.800 definable and seem to be distinct\n01:14:18.840 factors of the Psychopathology of adult\n01:14:21.560 ADHD let's just look at another one okay\n01:14:25.120 accept emotional disregulation is a\n01:14:27.719 primary symptom in adult deficit\n01:14:29.560 hyperactivity disorder right\n01:14:31.239 dysfunctional emotion regulation\n01:14:33.360 significantly contributes to impairment\n01:14:34.960 in several domains with\n01:14:36.920 ADHD there's even a let's try\n01:14:42.719 subtype um there's a good paper\n01:14:47.199 here that I can't find now so there's\n01:14:51.080 there's some there there's some people\n01:14:54.679 like researchers who have actually\n01:14:57.440 hypothesized that you know how we have\n01:14:59.600 ADD and ADHD so attention deficit\n01:15:02.679 disorder or attention deficit\n01:15:04.639 hyperactivity\n01:15:06.520 disorder and so some people have\n01:15:08.400 hypothesized that there is a third\n01:15:10.280 subtype of ADHD that is or add that is\n01:15:13.199 attention deficit disorder with\n01:15:15.199 emotional\n01:15:17.600 disregulation and so emotional\n01:15:19.320 disregulation is a huge part of ADHD so\n01:15:23.360 people with ADHD feel especially\n01:15:26.719 negative emotions much more quickly more\n01:15:30.159 intensely so the onset of action is more\n01:15:32.840 rapid the intensity of the emotion is\n01:15:35.480 more rapid and the duration of the\n01:15:37.480 emotion is\n01:15:39.239 longer so what let's understand this we\n01:15:41.679 have this part of our brain called the\n01:15:43.080 amygdala in our lyic system which is our\n01:15:44.960 negative emot our emotional\n01:15:47.360 circuitry and remember that in ADHD we\n01:15:49.920 have executive function deficits we have\n01:15:52.120 control deficits in our frontal loes\n01:15:56.159 so control deficits in our frontal loes\n01:15:59.239 lead to things like impulsivity if we're\n01:16:01.440 looking at the relationship between the\n01:16:02.960 nucleus succumbent in the frontal loes\n01:16:05.120 so nucleus cumbent is like I want it\n01:16:07.120 give it to me let's do\n01:16:08.560 it that's nucleus succumbent we have\n01:16:10.800 trouble controlling that if we have ADHD\n01:16:12.679 but that's not the only thing that the\n01:16:14.040 frontal lobe\n01:16:15.360 controls it also restrains our negative\n01:16:19.800 emotions so emotional disregulation is a\n01:16:23.159 huge problem for people with ADH\n01:16:25.600 and the reason that this is a big\n01:16:27.040 problem is not just that they have this\n01:16:28.600 neuroscientific deficit but that our\n01:16:31.120 society assumes a certain level of\n01:16:34.360 emotional regulation capability we\n01:16:37.080 assume a neurotypical emotional\n01:16:39.239 regulation\n01:16:40.520 problem and so what tends to happen is\n01:16:42.920 when people have difficulty regulating\n01:16:45.400 their emotions we do not support them in\n01:16:48.480 teaching them emotional regulation\n01:16:50.239 skills we just tell them that they need\n01:16:53.040 to do it\n01:16:55.040 right so this is the big problem is\n01:16:56.480 unlike someone who's missing a leg where\n01:16:58.760 we're like hey friend since you're\n01:17:01.080 missing a leg we will do things like\n01:17:02.960 build ramps for you we will do things\n01:17:05.040 like provide you with a wheelchair we\n01:17:06.760 will do things like provide you with a\n01:17:08.239 prosthetic so that we can correct your\n01:17:10.880 deficiency and you can participate in\n01:17:13.159 something of a normal life and when we\n01:17:15.440 do that for people who are missing limbs\n01:17:18.080 they're capable of living relatively\n01:17:20.600 normal lives they still have challenges\n01:17:23.639 we're not saying that but if if we look\n01:17:25.159 at the psychological consequences these\n01:17:27.520 people can do things like hold jobs they\n01:17:29.920 can get married they can have kids if\n01:17:32.000 that's what they want to do they can go\n01:17:33.320 on vacation they can get on planes we\n01:17:35.560 have so many accommodations for people\n01:17:38.159 with physical handicaps we have very few\n01:17:41.159 accommodations or arguably no very few\n01:17:44.400 accommodations for people with mental\n01:17:46.040 handicaps and that too is such\n01:17:47.920 especially on platforms like what we\n01:17:49.560 stream ha mental\n01:17:51.679 handicap we use that term so in such a\n01:17:54.960 derogatory way right so these people are\n01:17:58.040 neurodiverse their brains are wired in a\n01:18:00.440 slightly different way they're not\n01:18:02.920 capable of the same things at\n01:18:05.960 default and so we must make\n01:18:07.840 accommodations for them and\n01:18:09.199 accommodations doesn't mean that we want\n01:18:10.679 to make everything in their life easier\n01:18:12.400 we want to do the work for them this\n01:18:14.120 means that we want to help train their\n01:18:16.520 brains in the way that they need to\n01:18:19.120 compensate for the way things\n01:18:21.760 are right it's just like even if we look\n01:18:24.000 at something like red green color\n01:18:25.520 blindness we have video games now that\n01:18:27.679 have color blind friendly modes like\n01:18:29.840 that's cool that's what we need for ADHD\n01:18:32.360 as well we need ways to build habits we\n01:18:34.920 need ways of Behavioral reinforcement\n01:18:36.760 that account for these things ways to\n01:18:38.520 regulate emotions that account for these\n01:18:40.920 things but we don't and so the problem\n01:18:43.639 is that people suffer because standard\n01:18:46.159 Solutions don't\n01:18:47.560 work right it's like someone without\n01:18:49.760 legs and we're just telling them hey bro\n01:18:52.360 or girl climb stairs just climb stairs\n01:18:56.480 and it's like you can do it right if\n01:18:57.960 you've got no legs you can go up a\n01:18:59.960 flight of stairs it's doable it's just\n01:19:02.639 going to be\n01:19:03.760 exhausting to climb one flight of stairs\n01:19:06.199 is going to be so exhausting and this is\n01:19:08.040 what happens with our cognitive the\n01:19:10.000 cognitive world that we live in where we\n01:19:12.639 assume that people can deal with\n01:19:14.159 reminders we assume that people's\n01:19:16.120 attention is capable of being focused so\n01:19:18.560 we have some 1H hour boring ass meeting\n01:19:21.040 and even if we know it's a boring ass\n01:19:22.639 meeting we're expecting people to be\n01:19:23.920 able to pay attention to some degree\n01:19:25.960 torture for someone with ADHD absolute\n01:19:29.679 torture and so this is the problem that\n01:19:31.760 we\n01:19:33.040 create and then what we end up\n01:19:36.880 with is\n01:19:44.560 this when\n01:19:47.000 everything comes to\n01:19:49.159 pass we end up with can't trust your own\n01:19:52.960 judgment because of all all of these\n01:19:55.560 other failures you lose confidence in\n01:20:00.000 yourself so then what we've really done\n01:20:02.480 now this is kind of like the last nail\n01:20:04.120 in the\n01:20:05.040 coffin so as we mentioned people with\n01:20:07.239 ADHD can sometimes grow up to be\n01:20:09.880 depressed but see once you lose\n01:20:12.159 confidence in yourself the fundamental\n01:20:14.560 unit of agency in your life is\n01:20:18.960 gone so if we look at a human being's\n01:20:21.800 capacity\n01:20:25.000 to deal with adversity the most powerful\n01:20:28.440 thing we can have is\n01:20:30.760 confidence confidence is what determines\n01:20:33.159 whether something is a setback or a\n01:20:35.440 failure and the child with ADHD the\n01:20:38.199 young adult the adult with ADHD\n01:20:40.440 concludes that I cannot trust\n01:20:43.800 myself and now you're in big\n01:20:46.840 trouble because a big part of life is\n01:20:49.679 trusting yourself why because you can\n01:20:52.000 trust in other people but other people\n01:20:53.800 are not 100%\n01:20:56.080 you see if you are don't trust your own\n01:21:00.280 taste in food and you look around at\n01:21:02.600 what other people are enjoying you can\n01:21:03.960 still get some enjoyment but to have the\n01:21:06.320 perfect meal you need to look into\n01:21:08.400 yourself you need to ask yourself what\n01:21:10.320 do I enjoy that's the way to get a\n01:21:12.679 perfect meal it isn't to find what\n01:21:15.600 someone else is eating and enjoy that\n01:21:18.760 but this is what happens then they lose\n01:21:20.320 the capacity to trust their own judgment\n01:21:22.639 their own confidence and now I've lost a\n01:21:25.679 a very\n01:21:27.360 fundamental barometer or thermometer or\n01:21:30.480 measurement stick for my life because if\n01:21:33.719 you think about anything in life you can\n01:21:35.239 get the best advice in the world you can\n01:21:37.280 have people make food for you you can\n01:21:38.840 have people pick out clothing for you\n01:21:40.280 you can have people pick video games for\n01:21:41.719 you you can have people pick all kinds\n01:21:43.120 of stuff you can do things and you can\n01:21:44.480 do it pretty well you can look at\n01:21:45.920 reviews you can look at this you can\n01:21:47.159 look at advice but at the end of the day\n01:21:49.600 your life comes down to\n01:21:51.840 you you have to decide for yourself what\n01:21:54.719 you like what you don't like what works\n01:21:56.280 what doesn't work and when you lose the\n01:21:58.400 capacity to trust yourself you will\n01:22:00.199 become directionless in\n01:22:02.600 life what this looks like is that you\n01:22:05.040 are constantly looking outside for\n01:22:07.280 answers but those answers don't\n01:22:08.960 translate 100% to you so you're looking\n01:22:11.199 for another answer and another answer\n01:22:12.920 and another answer and then you get to\n01:22:14.840 this conclusion that nothing works for\n01:22:18.920 me works for all these other people but\n01:22:21.880 none of these Solutions I've seen this\n01:22:23.679 so many times I've had people come into\n01:22:25.239 my office I've seen 10\n01:22:27.920 psychiatrists nothing works I'm\n01:22:31.719 hopeless so they come to me and they're\n01:22:33.719 like you do this weird alternative\n01:22:35.120 medicine stuff maybe you can fix me and\n01:22:36.920 I'm like [ __ ] I can't fix you if you've\n01:22:40.080 seen 10 psychiatrist why do you think\n01:22:41.600 I'm smarter than they are I'm\n01:22:45.080 not this if you want to fix your life\n01:22:47.560 and you've gone to 10 different people\n01:22:49.120 for help if you tried everything under\n01:22:51.120 the sun there's one only one place left\n01:22:54.120 to go which is towards yourself because\n01:22:56.880 other people's Solutions don't work for\n01:22:58.360 you we've already determined that and\n01:23:01.239 when that person comes into my office\n01:23:02.840 and says I've tried 10 other people\n01:23:04.639 maybe you can help me there's one way in\n01:23:07.560 which I can help them and this what this\n01:23:08.920 is what determines whether this person\n01:23:10.040 gets better or not which is can I teach\n01:23:12.159 this person can I help this person\n01:23:13.920 reconnect with themselves and find their\n01:23:15.719 own Solutions\n01:23:18.679 because there people who are better than\n01:23:20.760 me that have already tried and they've\n01:23:22.120 failed there's no way that I can succeed\n01:23:23.600 the answer has to come from\n01:23:25.480 you and this is the real tragedy the\n01:23:28.080 Paradox the irony call it whatever you\n01:23:29.880 want to is that we take these kids with\n01:23:32.639 ADHD and we teach them to distrust\n01:23:37.560 themselves and then it becomes almost\n01:23:40.600 impossible so if we look at\n01:23:42.239 Psychotherapy for ADHD what do we do so\n01:23:45.159 when I have a patient who comes in with\n01:23:47.239 ADHD I also in the back of my mind am\n01:23:50.400 focusing on depression treatment until\n01:23:52.560 proven otherwise trauma treat treatment\n01:23:54.760 until proven otherwise these three\n01:23:56.440 things addiction treatment until proven\n01:23:58.760 otherwise so anytime someone comes into\n01:24:01.120 my office with ADHD these are the three\n01:24:03.760 additional diagnoses that I am very\n01:24:06.080 vigilant for because chances are there's\n01:24:08.280 some element of addiction depression and\n01:24:11.040 Trauma in this person's\n01:24:14.639 life and the research backs that up by\n01:24:17.080 the way this isn't you know just me\n01:24:19.000 randomly coming up with things because I\n01:24:20.639 see it\n01:24:24.440 because\n01:24:25.480 unlike growing up without legs we don't\n01:24:28.120 have a society that accommodates people\n01:24:29.960 with ADHD you can get extra time on\n01:24:32.360 tests whoop do you [ __ ] do shocking\n01:24:35.639 I'm going to tell youall something crazy\n01:24:38.000 okay there's also a gendered component\n01:24:40.040 ADHD which I'm working on a video\n01:24:42.760 on so if we look at people who get\n01:24:48.639 divorced\n01:24:51.239 60% of women with ADHD\n01:24:55.560 oh\n01:24:57.000 sorry men this is going to sound bad I'm\n01:25:00.239 just trying to remember the exact\n01:25:06.520 phrasing women with ADHD have a 60%\n01:25:10.440 likelihood to get divorced from their\n01:25:12.840 partner because of their\n01:25:16.320 ADHD 10% of men are likely to get\n01:25:19.719 divorced from their partner because of\n01:25:21.800 their\n01:25:23.320 ADHD so we haven't even scratched the\n01:25:25.880 surface of a lot of these\n01:25:27.840 consequences what does that mean I'm not\n01:25:29.679 saying that women have it worse than men\n01:25:31.600 please don't make that kind and we're\n01:25:33.199 just talking about statistics here okay\n01:25:36.080 what this means is that a lot of the\n01:25:39.520 societal expectations of\n01:25:43.199 women are impossible to meet or very\n01:25:46.400 difficult to meet if you have ADHD very\n01:25:48.280 simple thing women are expected to keep\n01:25:49.960 the house organized are expected to take\n01:25:52.320 care of the kids pack the lunches these\n01:25:54.719 things become incredibly difficult with\n01:25:56.840 ADHD the basic things that we Society\n01:25:59.800 expect from women become very difficult\n01:26:02.080 so women with ADHD are much more likely\n01:26:04.320 to go through divorce than than men and\n01:26:07.440 why is it it's because of this this is\n01:26:09.440 what the research suggests right I'm not\n01:26:11.480 saying that men have it easier please do\n01:26:14.080 not so I've noticed this tendency in\n01:26:16.719 this community where when I say make a\n01:26:18.480 statement people will jump to a very\n01:26:20.560 black and white way of thinking please\n01:26:22.199 don't do that\n01:26:25.080 right and this happens when I talk about\n01:26:26.639 how men would men kill themselves and\n01:26:28.719 then people will get upset and they'll\n01:26:30.400 say that but women struggle with suicide\n01:26:31.840 too yes I'm not in my experience as a\n01:26:34.880 psychiatrist I don't think one gender\n01:26:36.520 has it way easier than the other it's\n01:26:38.320 just we're all [ __ ] in different\n01:26:40.840 ways and the right answer is that we\n01:26:43.320 should have compassion for all people\n01:26:45.520 for the difficulties that they have and\n01:26:47.400 when it comes to a diagnosis there are\n01:26:49.400 gender specific manifestations of a\n01:26:51.880 diagnosis it's not all the same men and\n01:26:54.000 women don't live equal lives they we all\n01:26:57.280 experience the world in a very different\n01:26:59.000 way and we have our own unique\n01:27:00.679 challenges it is our job to look at the\n01:27:03.880 data and understand in what ways this\n01:27:07.400 particular disease process manifests in\n01:27:10.159 a gendered way in a cultural\n01:27:14.159 way because human beings have separate\n01:27:18.960 lives and if we want to help all people\n01:27:21.639 we need to understand the societal\n01:27:24.239 expectations and pressures for both men\n01:27:26.360 and\n01:27:28.400 women right so I'm working on two videos\n01:27:30.960 right now one is about how men's anxiety\n01:27:33.560 is very different from anxiety and how\n01:27:36.080 women's ADHD is very different from\n01:27:39.239 ADHD it's very interesting so there are\n01:27:42.199 even some trials that show\n01:27:44.679 that stimulant\n01:27:46.800 medication does not improve symptoms for\n01:27:50.639 women crazy crazy crazy there's a couple\n01:27:53.760 of Trials\n01:27:54.840 and why because stimulant medication is\n01:27:57.639 very effective at treating\n01:27:59.800 hyperactivity but women are much less\n01:28:01.960 likely to be\n01:28:05.480 hyperactive\n01:28:11.040 okay\n01:28:12.600 so yeah if you guys\n01:28:16.360 here\n01:28:18.520 okay so just to kind of\n01:28:22.480 summarize see when we look at this kind\n01:28:24.679 of stuff we can look at this stuff all\n01:28:26.400 this stuff I think is very\n01:28:29.159 accurate now even though I'm sort of\n01:28:31.239 talking Doom and\n01:28:32.679 Gloom there's one very important thing\n01:28:35.239 to\n01:28:36.920 remember if we want to fix a problem we\n01:28:39.880 have to understand it we have to\n01:28:42.040 understand how it happens so please\n01:28:44.159 don't take what I'm saying as a feature\n01:28:46.239 of hopelessness and this is where I\n01:28:48.239 think this is I don't know that Dr\n01:28:50.159 Barkley was saying this but he says it's\n01:28:52.199 impossible I I I mean I don't think\n01:28:53.880 that's actually what he means I I don't\n01:28:55.199 think he thinks that ADHD is a hopeless\n01:28:57.280 diagnosis I think we know that there are\n01:28:59.000 evidence-based interventions but we have\n01:29:01.239 to start by understanding what the\n01:29:02.760 problem is and the biggest problem in\n01:29:05.560 ADHD is misdiagnosis when people tell\n01:29:07.920 you to work harder or just wake up on\n01:29:10.480 time or use sticky notes to remind\n01:29:12.560 yourself people come up with all of\n01:29:14.520 these Solutions the reason they don't\n01:29:16.080 work is because they are solutions to\n01:29:18.320 different problems the problems that\n01:29:20.520 someone with ADHD has are different and\n01:29:22.800 so we need tailored solutions to those\n01:29:25.119 problems things that neurotypical people\n01:29:27.199 will never even think\n01:29:28.920 of so chances are one of my kids is\n01:29:31.440 somewhere once again on the ADHD\n01:29:33.119 Spectrum she inherited my good\n01:29:35.679 genes and so the things that I have to\n01:29:37.960 teach her as a parent are things that I\n01:29:41.679 would never have thought to teach they\n01:29:44.320 seem so simple and\n01:29:48.920 basic right so for for example I'll ask\n01:29:51.800 my daughter\n01:29:55.159 let's say we're talking about reminders\n01:29:57.360 and so what I find is that to really\n01:29:59.239 work with someone with ADHD you have to\n01:30:00.960 do two or three additional steps to\n01:30:03.400 translate a neurotypical solution for a\n01:30:05.960 neurodiverse person so if we take\n01:30:08.400 something like writing a sticky\n01:30:11.719 note so if I I'll say okay you can write\n01:30:14.239 a reminder but then I have to go two\n01:30:15.960 steps further I have to ask her what do\n01:30:18.480 we do with reminders what's the purpose\n01:30:21.119 of a reminder and then she's like kind\n01:30:23.440 of confused and she's like to remind me\n01:30:26.520 and I say yes that is very good what\n01:30:30.159 makes it hard for us to remember sticky\n01:30:34.639 notes how are you going to remember to\n01:30:37.040 read a sticky note and she's like make a\n01:30:40.080 sticky note to remember my sticky note I\n01:30:42.639 said very\n01:30:44.679 good how are you going to remember to\n01:30:48.080 remember your sticky note and she's like\n01:30:52.280 make another sticky note I'm fused this\n01:30:55.119 isn't going to work and I'm like ABS\n01:30:57.880 [ __ ] lutely I don't say [ __ ] cuz\n01:30:59.840 she's\n01:31:01.400 six this is not going to\n01:31:04.560 work take a deep breath now let's figure\n01:31:07.920 out what do you think will\n01:31:11.040 work okay let's put the sticky note\n01:31:13.840 let's forget about the sticky note\n01:31:16.000 entirely as a reminder what we're going\n01:31:18.280 to do is we're going to take the back of\n01:31:19.639 your door to your school room and we're\n01:31:23.119 going to put all all of your sticky\n01:31:24.760 notes on the back of the door and the\n01:31:27.199 first thing that you need to do when you\n01:31:28.880 come home every single day is look at\n01:31:31.760 the back of the\n01:31:33.159 door the whole system has to be made for\n01:31:36.239 her she needs help making\n01:31:39.520 it right so what's the first thing that\n01:31:41.600 we do when we come home we're going to\n01:31:43.080 put our snack away we're going to go to\n01:31:44.760 the back of the door and we're going to\n01:31:46.040 see what's written on there you have to\n01:31:48.199 bake the you have to teach them how to\n01:31:49.800 bake the\n01:31:51.440 system does that make sense so this is\n01:31:54.440 what's missing in ADHD this is what ADHD\n01:31:56.440 treatment\n01:31:57.679 is is teaching people these kinds it's\n01:32:00.480 providing scaffolding so that you can\n01:32:06.679 Thrive so it's not hopeless but we need\n01:32:10.159 customized\n01:32:11.639 Solutions we need neurodiverse\n01:32:15.719 Solutions and so a lot of people in our\n01:32:17.719 community have been awesome at figuring\n01:32:19.320 this stuff out people will you know\n01:32:21.000 share their experiences that's awesome\n01:32:23.119 we have a whole guide about ADHD where\n01:32:25.600 we go into these\n01:32:28.239 things you know step by step what are\n01:32:30.560 the things that you need to\n01:32:32.239 do what what are the strengths what are\n01:32:34.239 the weaknesses what are the difficulties\n01:32:35.520 how are things different for you you\n01:32:36.639 have to understand all of this\n01:32:38.920 stuff and then the beautiful thing is\n01:32:40.920 that once you figure some of this stuff\n01:32:42.440 out then things start to change this\n01:32:45.199 begins to\n01:32:47.560 change right this begins to change this\n01:32:51.119 begins to\n01:32:52.159 change instead of def faulting to\n01:32:54.360 solutions that work for other people\n\nThe file is too long and its

transcript you uploaded is very detailed but quite lengthy. Here's a structured **summary** of the key points covered in the video:\n\n---\n\n### **Topic: Are You an ADHD Doomer?**\nThis video focuses on the challenges faced by individuals with ADHD, societal misconceptions, and tailored strategies to manage ADHD effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Themes:**\n1. **ADHD as a Disorder of Attention**  \n   - ADHD involves difficulties in controlling attention.  \n   - People with ADHD may hyperfocus on certain tasks but struggle to shift their attention when needed.  \n\n2. **Challenges with Delayed Gratification**  \n   - ADHD brains are wired for immediate rewards.  \n   - Tasks requiring delayed gratification, like studying or building habits, are exceptionally difficult without external support or scaffolding.\n\n3. **Struggles with Habit Formation**  \n   - People with ADHD can form habits, but only when there is consistent and immediate reinforcement.  \n   - This often results in habits tied to activities that provide instant gratification (e.g., video games).  \n\n4. **Emotional Dysregulation**  \n   - Emotional responses in ADHD are more intense, faster in onset, and longer-lasting.  \n   - This creates challenges in regulating emotions, often leading to interpersonal or self-esteem issues.\n\n5. **Misdiagnosis and Stigma**  \n   - ADHD is both underdiagnosed (especially in women) and overdiagnosed.  \n   - Many are labeled as \"lazy\" or \"unmotivated,\" creating a cycle of low self-esteem and depression.  \n\n6. **Tailored Solutions**  \n   - Traditional neurotypical solutions like sticky notes or simple reminders often fail.  \n   - ADHD individuals need custom systems (e.g., visual cues on doors or consistent external reminders) to thrive.  \n\n---\n\n### **Big Takeaway:**\nADHD is not about lack of effort but about brain wiring. Success requires understanding the unique challenges of ADHD and designing **neurodiverse solutions**. These solutions emphasize building scaffolding systems for memory, habit formation, and emotional regulation.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific point or section! 😊"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002,200007]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-Wud3tXQj3","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"cfcfa65f-42de-4cd1-a39b-f9f061ba1dc7","request_id":"90653239ee90a3de-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cfcfa65f-42de-4cd1-a39b-f9f061ba1dc7","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"ab7829dd-8e07-4951-bddc-fdcfc5ded439","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"6791cbb3-0438-8002-a534-0c478abbd409","conversation_template_id":"g-Wud3tXQj3","gizmo_id":"g-Wud3tXQj3","gizmo_type":"gpt","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":["https://www.youtube.com/watch/qbPpZCjeur8","https://www.youtube.com/live/qbPpZCjeur8?si=BV62yKQqLhvCSefE"],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
