are all the labels currently in your Todoist account, along with their potential usage based on common GTD principles:\n\n### Labels and Potential Usage:\n\n1. **next** (Favorite)\n   - **Usage**: Marks tasks that represent the next actionable step. This is a critical part of the GTD system, ensuring focus on what can be done immediately without waiting on prerequisites.\n\n2. **waiting_for** (Favorite)\n   - **Usage**: Applied to tasks or projects where you’re waiting for someone else to take action or provide input. Helps to track dependencies and ensures follow-ups.\n\n3. **calls**\n   - **Usage**: Categorizes tasks requiring phone calls. Groups similar tasks together to batch-process them efficiently during appropriate times.\n\n4. **email**\n   - **Usage**: Used for tasks involving sending or responding to emails. Helps consolidate email-based work for focused productivity.\n\n5. **home**\n   - **Usage**: Tags tasks that need to be completed at home. Useful for location-based task filtering when you are in your home environment.\n\n6. **work**\n   - **Usage**: Identifies tasks related to work or professional commitments. Enables separation of personal and professional responsibilities.\n\n7. **errands**\n   - **Usage**: Applied to tasks requiring travel or shopping, like picking up groceries or dropping off packages. Groups all out-of-home tasks for efficient planning.\n\n### Observations:\n- These labels align well with GTD principles by categorizing tasks based on action context (e.g., calls, email), location (e.g., home, work), or status (e.g., next, waiting_for).\n- The **next** and **waiting_for** labels are particularly critical for task prioritization and follow-ups, ensuring smooth workflows.\n\nIf you’d like, I can help suggest improvements or adjustments to these labels based on your specific workflows or goals.

Here’s a breakdown of its core principles:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Capture: Collect What Has Your Attention**\n- **Purpose**: Get everything out of your head and into a trusted system (like a notebook, app, or Todoist) so you can focus on doing, not remembering.\n- **How**: Write down all tasks, ideas, commitments, and worries as they arise. This is often referred to as a \"brain dump.\"\n- **Example**: Using Todoist's Inbox to capture tasks as they occur to you throughout the day.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Clarify: Process What It Means**\n- **Purpose**: Decide the next steps for each item you've captured.\n- **Steps**:\n  - **Is it actionable?**\n    - If no, it goes into one of three categories:\n      - **Trash**: If it’s irrelevant.\n      - **Reference**: For useful information.\n      - **Someday/Maybe**: For ideas to revisit later.\n    - If yes, decide the **Next Action**:\n      - **Two-Minute Rule**: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.\n      - Delegate it: If someone else can do it.\n      - Defer it: Schedule it for later or place it in a project.\n- **Example**: Sorting tasks into projects like \"Personal Finance\" or \"Work\" and labeling with `next` or `waiting_for`.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Organize: Put It Where It Belongs**\n- **Purpose**: Arrange actionable tasks into appropriate categories so you can find them easily when needed.\n- **Key Elements**:\n  - **Projects**: Outcomes that require multiple steps.\n  - **Next Actions**: Single, specific tasks you can act on immediately.\n  - **Waiting For**: Tasks delegated to others.\n  - **Calendar**: Time-specific tasks or events.\n  - **Someday/Maybe**: Tasks you might do in the future.\n- **Example**: Use Todoist projects, sections, and labels to group and prioritize tasks effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Reflect: Review Frequently**\n- **Purpose**: Keep your system current and relevant.\n- **Key Practices**:\n  - **Weekly Review**: Review your projects, next actions, and goals to ensure you're on track.\n  - Update your tasks and projects regularly to reflect changing priorities.\n- **Example**: Use your \"Weekly Review\" project to assess progress and plan for the week ahead.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Engage: Do the Work**\n- **Purpose**: Focus on tasks based on context, time, energy, and priorities.\n- **Steps**:\n  - Use the **Four Criteria** to choose what to do:\n    - **Context**: What tools or resources do you have available? (e.g., calls when near a phone).\n    - **Time Available**: How much time do you have right now?\n    - **Energy Available**: Choose tasks that match your current energy level.\n    - **Priority**: Focus on what matters most.\n- **Example**: Filter tasks by `@errands` when you’re out running errands or `@work` when you’re in the office.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of GTD\n1. **Reduced Overwhelm**: By capturing everything in a trusted system, your mind stays clear for creative and strategic thinking.\n2. **Clarity**: Clear next actions eliminate confusion about what to do next.\n3. **Focus**: Tasks are categorized so you can tackle them based on your current situation and resources.\n4. **Flexibility**: GTD adapts to changing priorities and workflows.\n\n---\n\n### GTD in Todoist\nTodoist is an excellent tool for implementing GTD:\n- **Inbox**: For capturing tasks.\n- **Labels**: For contexts like `@home` or `@calls`.\n- **Projects**: To organize tasks into outcomes (e.g., \"Personal Finance\" or \"Active Projects\").\n- **Sections**: To break down projects into manageable parts.\n- **Filters**: To quickly find tasks based on criteria like priority or context.\n\nWould you like help implementing or refining GTD in your Todoist setup?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop"},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"aaa2cbd6-bee0-40f6-a90b-fdae65cb58de","request_id":"9010180b0953eb05-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This

Long-term tasks like \"Create will\" or \"Brainstorm AI business ideas\" could fit here.\n\n3. **Lack of Context Labels**:\n   - Although you have labels like `@calls`, `@email`, and `@errands`, they are underutilized in task organization.\n\n4. **Health & Wellness and Home & Lifestyle Projects**:\n   - These projects seem underutilized. Tasks related to home maintenance or personal well-being could go here instead of staying in the Inbox.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement**\n#### 1. **Strengthen Inbox Management**\n   - **Goal**: Process tasks in the Inbox daily to reduce overwhelm.\n   - **Action**:\n     - Use the GTD framework to clarify tasks immediately:\n       - Delegate tasks if possible (e.g., tasks requiring input from Farzana or John).\n       - Assign actionable tasks to specific projects and sections.\n       - Move long-term tasks to **Someday/Maybe**.\n   - Example: Move \"Create will\" to **Someday/Maybe**, or \"Discuss twin bed options\" to **Health & Wellness**.\n\n#### 2. **Leverage Context Labels**\n   - **Goal**: Enable easier task filtering by context.\n   - **Action**:\n     - Apply labels like `@calls`, `@errands`, or `@work` consistently to every task.\n     - Create filters in Todoist to focus on tasks relevant to your current context.\n   - Example: Label \"Compile roofing knowledge base\" as `@deep_work` and \"Follow up on HELOC\" as `@calls`.\n\n#### 3. **Expand Health & Wellness and Home & Lifestyle**\n   - **Goal**: Bring more focus to personal well-being and home organization.\n   - **Action**:\n     - Move related tasks into these projects.\n     - Example:\n       - \"Look into ways to increase water intake\" → **Health & Wellness**.\n       - \"Remove Ubiquiti router from Willow St rental\" → **Home & Lifestyle**.\n\n#### 4. **Optimize Agendas**\n   - **Goal**: Make meetings and follow-ups more actionable.\n   - **Action**:\n     - Pre-populate agenda sections with recurring tasks or key topics.\n     - Example: Add \"Discuss preschool plans with Farzana\" to the **Farzana** section of **Agendas**.\n\n#### 5. **Better Use of Someday/Maybe**\n   - **Goal**: Organize long-term ideas or tasks without cluttering active projects.\n   - **Action**:\n     - Move tasks like \"Brainstorm AI business ideas\" and \"Build AI marketing solution\" here until they become actionable.\n\n#### 6. **Leverage Filters for Review**\n   - **Goal**: Make it easier to review tasks.\n   - **Action**:\n     - Create custom filters to group tasks based on deadlines, labels, or priorities.\n     - Example:\n       - Filter: `Today & Overdue` → Shows overdue and same-day tasks across projects.\n       - Filter: `Priority 1` → Focus on high-priority tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Sample Workflow After Improvements\n1. **Daily Processing**:\n   - Process the Inbox and assign tasks to appropriate projects, labels, or **Someday/Maybe**.\n   - Example: \"Compile updated schedule for 6013 Perry Dr\" → **Windy City Construction** > **Active Projects** with label `@urgent`.\n\n2. **Weekly Review**:\n   - Use the **Weekly Review** project and sections to reflect, plan, and track progress.\n   - Example: Check **Track Progress** to see ongoing efforts in AmeriShield or Bismillah Technologies.\n\n3. **Context-Based Execution**:\n   - Work on tasks based on their context using labels and filters.\n   - Example: Use a `@calls` filter to batch all phone calls at once.\n\n---\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed or if you'd like help implementing any of these changes!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-677eacec11c48191b84b0958866303aa","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa26653-2210-426f-afb0-a7253e818a6a","request_id":"9010b5156a3a1236-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_tool_use","description":"This model doesn't support using tools."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"gpt-4o-jawbone","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_attachment","description":"This model doesn't support file attachments."},{"slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_gizmo","description":"This GPT is not supported"}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa26653-2210-426f-afb0-a7253e818a6a","children":["aaa2ef69-c876-462f-888c-41dd373bd963"]},"aaa2ef69-c876-462f-888c-41dd373bd963":{"id":"aaa2ef69-c876-462f-888c-41dd373bd963","message":{"id":"aaa2ef69-c876-462f-888c-41dd373bd963","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736722381.131396,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What sections would you suggest for each sub project based on your analysis"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"9010b858596e1236-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1d2c40c6-bc88-46ff-934f-4670df266029","children":["cd14e8f6-4e41-4397-8cd5-08611c0071ec"]},"cd14e8f6-4e41-4397-8cd5-08611c0071ec":{"id":"cd14e8f6-4e41-4397-8cd5-08611c0071ec","message":{"id":"cd14e8f6-4e41-4397-8cd5-08611c0071ec","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1736722397.669871,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here are section suggestions for each sub-project based on your current tasks, GTD methodology, and your workflows:\n\n---\n\n### **1.
