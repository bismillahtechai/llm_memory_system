The property was financed using a **hard money loan** from **Chicago Hard Money/Chicago Bridge Loan**, with **Lee Ballin** as your point of contact.\n\n---\n\n### **Your Relationship with the Hard Money Lender**\n- **Loan Structure**: The financing for 6013 Perry Drive was secured through **Chicago Hard Money/Chicago Bridge Loan**, a private lender specializing in short-term, high-interest loans for real estate investors.\n- **Carrying Costs & Challenges**: Hard money loans come with **high interest rates** and **short repayment timelines**, making them expensive if projects take longer than expected.\n- **Delays & Stop Work Orders**: \n  - You encountered a **stop work order** due to not pulling permits, causing significant project delays. \n  - This increased carrying costs and risk, as hard money lenders typically don’t offer flexibility in repayment schedules.\n- **Lessons Learned**: From your past experience (such as 1504 Rutland Lane), you know that delays caused by permitting issues and unforeseen challenges can **eat into profits** and **increase financial pressure** when using hard money loans.\n\n---\n\n### **Your Fix & Flip Process for 6013 Perry Drive**\n#### **Key Challenges Faced**\n1. **Permit Issues**: \n   - Work was halted due to permit-related violations, requiring additional time to resolve.\n   - You’ve now developed a deep understanding of **navigating permit processes**, though this setback added **extra costs**.\n  \n2. **Team Issues**:\n   - You initially had a team working on the project but are now **completing it alone**, meaning progress is slower and requires extreme efficiency.\n\n3. **Financial Pressure**:\n   - The longer the project takes, the more **carrying costs from the hard money loan** eat into potential profits.\n   - Selling 6013 Perry Drive is a **critical priority** to free up capital and stabilize your financial situation.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Status & Priorities for 6013 Perry Drive**\n#### **Primary Goal: Sell ASAP**\n- Selling the property is essential to **pay off the hard money loan**, recover costs, and fund your next ventures.\n- Market conditions and property pricing will **heavily influence** your exit strategy.\n\n#### **Strategic Takeaways for Future Fix & Flips**\n- **Permitting should always be handled upfront** to avoid costly stop work orders.\n- **Hard money loans are only viable with strict project timelines**—delays quickly make them unprofitable.\n- **A reliable team is essential** to executing fix-and-flips efficiently; doing everything alone slows down progress.\n\n---\n\n### **Bigger Picture: How 6013 Perry Drive Fits into Your Vision**\n- You’re transitioning from a traditional **fix-and-flip model** to a **tech-driven real estate investment strategy** under **Bismillah Technologies**.\n- Your AI-driven **real estate acquisition system** aims to:\n  - Reduce risk by identifying **better off-market deals**.\n  - **Automate permit tracking** to prevent stop work orders.\n  - Optimize **rehab timelines** and financial modeling to avoid unnecessary holding costs.\n\n6013 Perry Drive has been a learning experience, reinforcing the need for **tighter execution, smarter financing strategies, and AI-driven decision-making** for future projects. \n\nWould you like to discuss a pricing strategy for the sale, or are there specific financial concerns related to this project you’d like to address?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"751637ab-a6fb-416f-b297-d20f4eb40687","request_id":"91406aa44dbf0046-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"751637ab-a6fb-416f-b297-d20f4eb40687","children":["4344b8e5-ca44-48ff-9090-0e7560381f4b"]},"4344b8e5-ca44-48ff-9090-0e7560381f4b":{"id":"4344b8e5-ca44-48ff-9090-0e7560381f4b","message":{"id":"4344b8e5-ca44-48ff-9090-0e7560381f4b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739906986.149781,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Now, Tell me everything you know about my adhd from all of your context and memory about me and how it has affected me and led to burnout"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"91406d845d010046-SJC","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"87f53a1e-2edf-445b-813f-7686cb2b7ec2","children":["665f0908-9100-43d7-8e23-e56651f5ea4a"]},"665f0908-9100-43d7-8e23-e56651f5ea4a":{"id":"665f0908-9100-43d7-8e23-e56651f5ea4a","message":{"id":"665f0908-9100-43d7-8e23-e56651f5ea4a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739907148.177295,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### **Your ADHD: A Deep Dive Into Its Impact on Your Life and Burnout**\n\nYour ADHD has been a **lifelong struggle** that went **undiagnosed for most of your life**, leading to significant challenges in personal, professional, and financial areas. The absence of proper diagnosis and support **forced you to adapt without understanding why you faced difficulties that others seemed to handle effortlessly**. This has played a major role in your experiences with **burnout, financial missteps, personal relationships, and self-worth**.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Early Life & The Root of the Struggle**\n- You grew up with **undiagnosed ADHD**, which meant that **you didn't receive the tools or strategies needed to manage it effectively**.\n- Instead of being recognized as ADHD-related struggles, your challenges were likely **misinterpreted as a lack of discipline, motivation, or responsibility**.\n- Your **education was rooted in a private Islamic schooling system**, where mental health was acknowledged in religious teachings but not always well-addressed in practical ways.\n- Over time, this led to feelings of **alienation and frustration**, especially when others didn’t seem to struggle with the same issues.\n\n---\n\n## **2. How ADHD Has Affected Your Productivity & Work Life**\nYour ADHD affects how you function in high-stress environments, contributing to **overwhelm, impulsivity, difficulty prioritizing, and burnout**.\n\n### **a) Hyperfocus vs. Paralysis**\n- **When engaged**, you can hyperfocus for long stretches (e.g., spending hours at the computer solving problems, planning, or researching). \n- However, hyperfocus on **one task often leads to neglecting others**, making you feel like **you’re busy but not productive** in a broader sense.\n- When overwhelmed, you struggle with **analysis paralysis**, causing tasks to pile up until they feel insurmountable.\n\n### **b) Project Execution & Follow-Through**\n- You have a **strong ability to generate innovative ideas** (AI-driven real estate systems, ContractorLens, Bismillah Technologies), but **execution becomes a challenge when multiple projects overlap**.\n- ADHD makes it **hard to organize and prioritize tasks**, causing frustration when you know what needs to be done but struggle to take action consistently.\n- This has directly impacted projects like **6013 Perry Drive**, where you're now working alone, balancing hands-on work with big-picture strategy.\n\n### **c) Impulsivity & Financial Struggles**\n- Impulsivity has played a role in **financial missteps**, such as **taking on debt without fully considering long-term consequences** or making purchases that later strain your budget.\n- This has led to **significant debt accumulation**, affecting both your business and personal life.\n- Your credit score and financial stability have suffered, adding stress and contributing to **feelings of failure or inadequacy** in your role as a provider.\n\n---\n\n## **3. ADHD & Burnout: The Cycle**\nYour **burnout isn’t just from overworking**—it’s from the **constant battle against your own brain**.\n\n### **a) The Perfectionism & Pressure**\n- You hold yourself to **high standards**, but ADHD makes it difficult to meet them consistently.\n- You often feel **guilt and frustration** over projects taking longer than expected, even when external factors (e.g., stop work orders) play a role.\n- The constant **push to prove yourself** (especially in business) leads to **mental exhaustion**.\n\n### **b) Decision Fatigue & Overwhelm**\n- ADHD makes **breaking down tasks and prioritizing difficult**, which causes procrastination.\n- Small, incomplete tasks **pile up** until they feel overwhelming.\n- Instead of taking action, your brain **shuts down**, leading to frustration and guilt.\n\n### **c) Juggling Too Many Responsibilities**\n- You are **running multiple businesses**, managing high-stakes projects, dealing with financial strain, and preparing for the arrival of your second child.\n- You’ve also lost your team for 6013 Perry Drive, leaving you to **handle all the framing and renovations alone**.\n- Balancing **long-term vision with immediate obligations** has been overwhelming, contributing to stress and burnout.\n\n---\n\n## **4. How ADHD Affects Your Personal Life**\n### **a) Relationships & Communication**\n- Your wife sometimes **struggles to understand what you do all day**, as ADHD makes you lose track of time when hyperfocused.\n- This can cause **tension**, as from the outside, it may appear that you're spending long hours at the computer without visible results.\n- You have a hard time **expressing your emotions**, which has made it difficult to **articulate your struggles and needs** to both your wife and your mother.\n- Your past attempts at **therapy haven’t been fully effective** because sessions were too short to provide a full picture of your ADHD challenges.\n\n### **b) Feeling Stuck & Inadequate**\n- **Financial struggles** and the pressure to provide for your family add to your stress.\n- You feel a **loss of control** when things spiral (debt, projects, responsibilities).\n- You’ve stopped engaging in **recreational activities** you once enjoyed, especially after your son was born and financial problems increased.\n- Feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt have **worsened over time**, particularly as you compare yourself to where you feel you “should” be.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Your ADHD Diagnosis Journey & Seeking Solutions**\n### **a) Finally Putting a Name to the Struggle**\n- You recently **started the process of getting officially diagnosed through ADHD Online (Mentavi Health)**.\n- You have always suspected ADHD was the root cause, but **getting a diagnosis is important for accessing proper treatment**.\n\n### **b) Struggles with Medical Understanding**\n- In past therapy sessions, your ADHD wasn’t properly addressed because **the focus was always on the most immediate issue (burnout, anxiety, stress, financial struggles)**.\n- You’ve **felt frustrated** by the medical system’s lack of understanding, where professionals sometimes **question the diagnosis rather than offering solutions**.\n- Your goal is to find a **therapeutic and medication combination** that allows you to **function consistently on a daily basis**.\n\n---\n\n## **6. How ADHD Has Shaped Your Future Goals**\nDespite all these struggles, your **ADHD is also your superpower**—it drives your **innovative thinking, risk-taking, and problem-solving**. However, **the challenge is building the right systems to manage it**.\n\n### **a) Bismillah Technologies: Automating What ADHD Makes Difficult**\nYour business, **Bismillah Technologies**, is a direct **response to your own struggles with ADHD**:\n- You're building AI-driven **automation systems** to handle **real estate, short-term rental management, contractor workflows, and financial planning**.\n- These tools will **streamline decision-making, eliminate repetitive tasks, and reduce the burden of ADHD-related disorganization**.\n- By creating these systems for yourself, you **remove the need for constant executive function, making it easier to scale your business**.\n\n### **b) Future ADHD Management Strategies**\n- You are actively seeking **medication and therapy** to create **consistency and sustainability** in your workflow.\n- You recognize that **external systems** (project management tools, AI assistants) will be critical to preventing future burnout.\n- You want to **set up a structure that allows you to focus on strategy while minimizing daily decision fatigue**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Takeaways**\nYour ADHD has been a **lifelong battle**, leading to **burnout, financial struggles, impulsive decisions, and difficulty with execution**. However, it’s also the **reason for your creativity, drive, and resilience**.\n\n### **The key takeaways from your journey:**\n1. **Your biggest challenge is prioritization and execution**—your ADHD makes **big ideas easy but structured follow-through difficult**.\n2. **Financial struggles have been amplified by ADHD-related impulsivity and executive dysfunction**, but you're actively working to correct this.\n3. **Burnout is a cycle caused by overcommitment, perfectionism, and overwhelm**, and breaking that cycle requires **both external systems and internal management (medication/therapy)**.\n4. **You are now building AI-driven automation to compensate for your ADHD challenges**, allowing you to scale your businesses without getting lost in the details.\n\nThis is a **turning point**—you’re no longer just **coping** with ADHD; you’re **actively designing a life and business that works with it, not against it**.\n\nWould you like to refine strategies for managing ADHD in specific areas (daily workflow, financial discipline, business execution, etc.)?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"4344b8e5-ca44-48ff-9090-0e7560381f4b","request_id":"91406d845d010046-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4344b8e5-ca44-48ff-9090-0e7560381f4b","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"665f0908-9100-43d7-8e23-e56651f5ea4a","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67b4df34-62e4-8002-8540-057235ab34ac","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
