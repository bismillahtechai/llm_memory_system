However, I can piece together some insights based on everything I know about your approach, priorities, and obstacles in your other projects.  \n\n### **What I Can Infer Based on Your Past Experiences & Current Context:**  \n#### **1. Financial & Funding Structure**  \n- Given your prior experiences, this project was likely financed using some mix of **hard money, private lending, or personal funds**.  \n- If there were delays (which seems likely based on your workload), there may have been **increased carrying costs** due to loan interest or holding expenses.  \n\n#### **2. Permit & Compliance Considerations**  \n- You’ve had issues with stop-work orders in past projects (**1504 Rutland Lane & 6013 Perry Drive**), so by the time you worked on Kenwood, you were likely much more **cautious about pulling permits properly**.  \n- If there were permit delays, they might have contributed to extended carrying costs.  \n\n#### **3. Scope of Work & Construction Complexity**  \n- Your **current project (6013 Perry Drive)** has had major scope shifts, and I assume that Kenwood also involved substantial remodeling rather than just cosmetic work.  \n- If it was a **flip**, then you likely focused on **ROI-driven improvements**—kitchen, bathrooms, curb appeal, and high-impact renovations.  \n- If it was a **rental**, you might have gone for **durable, low-maintenance finishes** while keeping the budget lean.  \n\n#### **4. Execution & Team Issues**  \n- **You lost your team recently**, meaning you’ve been handling the work yourself on 6013 Perry. It’s unclear if this also affected Kenwood, but if you had delays from unreliable subcontractors or a changing team, it might have slowed things down.  \n- If Kenwood is still ongoing, you may be juggling it alongside 6013 Perry, adding stress and reducing efficiency.  \n\n#### **5. Financial Goals & Exit Strategy**  \n- If you planned to **flip** Kenwood, you were likely targeting a sale within a specific timeframe to free up cash.  \n- If it was an **STR or long-term rental**, you might have factored it into your broader AI-driven real estate expansion.  \n- Given your financial situation, **selling it profitably** or at least breaking even was probably a high priority.  \n\n### **Open Questions to Fill in the Gaps**  \n1. **What was the original acquisition cost and financing structure?**  \n2. **What major renovations did you do, and did you run into unexpected expenses?**  \n3. **Is the project still ongoing, or has it been sold/completed?**  \n4. **Did you face any major challenges (permit issues, budget overruns, contractor delays)?**  \n5. **How does this project fit into your broader real estate strategy now?**  \n\nIf you give me more details, I can refine this into a more accurate breakdown."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"4b0a24e9-b8a3-4a16-9a50-bf41d210bd4d","request_id":"9147b73dce50e829-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"4b0a24e9-b8a3-4a16-9a50-bf41d210bd4d","children":["d99b0777-0d2a-4693-aa3d-02f29006ccaf"]},"d99b0777-0d2a-4693-aa3d-02f29006ccaf":{"id":"d99b0777-0d2a-4693-aa3d-02f29006ccaf","message":{"id":"d99b0777-0d2a-4693-aa3d-02f29006ccaf","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739985172.708238,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["28W-500 Kenwood Avenue is a project, is a client project for Windy City Construction. The client's name is Mirza Baig. He is an acquaintance that I had prior to Windy City Construction and I've known him for a long time. He is also, I've been acquainted with him for a long time. He's not, you know, somebody that I was close with. He's also a cousin of somebody that, you know, of my other friends. And so, you know, he's connected multiple ways. The issue is that he had initially reached out to me about a house that he was purchasing for his family and this was back in February 2024, so almost a year ago is when we finalized this. Actually, I think it was before that. I don't have the specifics, but basically there was a house that he found. For whatever reason, he latched on to this specific house and he decided that he wanted to do a 203k renovation loan. The problem is that this house was in an unincorporated area and all of the work that was ever done before was done not up to code and was done very hack job-ish. And so the house was built in 1960, maybe there was a permit pulled when the house was built and then, you know, over the decades, eventually it was converted to some corporate type of use for a church or some other religious organization. There was probably a permit pulled for that, but other than that, you know, all in between that, you know, there was no permits ever pulled and the work that was done was all subpar and there was many additions and, you know, it's a lot of garbage work on top of garbage work on top of garbage work. And now, when he bought it, it was in the middle of being DIY reno'd without a permit and it was in the middle of being foreclosed because the owners were going through a divorce. And so, you know, there was a lot of things wrong with it. A majority of other people would have walked away from that house. And his original plan was to go into the house, do as little work as possible, and move his family in, which is great, that was a great plan. But I had cautioned him because he wanted to pull, he was going through this 203k renovation loan process. His lender required that a permit be pulled in order for any funds to be dispersed. And so, because of that, we now had to submit plans. We now had to pull permits and then the entire project would have to be brought up to code. And because of the state of the, because of the state of the, of the house, this was going to add more budget than what he was willing to do in the first place, inherently. Because now, as soon as you pull a permit, now you have to deal with the county. And my previous, my previous dealings with different villages was that villages would, you know, the people that were looking at the permits and reviewing the permits, they just wanted the plans to be a certain way. And then the people that were actually coming out to do the inspections, the inspectors, they were okay with, you know, as long as the work is being done properly, then it's fine. You know, they're okay with it. They'll pass. It'll pass. And that's what I was operating on. But this was different because when we had called for a rough inspection, the plumber, plumbing inspector wanted the plans on site. And the, then the other inspector also, we had called him and he also wanted the plans on site and he said, everything on the plans need to be exactly how you're planning to do the work. And there were some slight variations. Something was, you know, very off, but maybe the number of fixtures, the type of fixtures, you know, maybe a soffit wasn't detailed, you know, small things like that. And so, but he said, all of those need to be on the plans. And so finally we got after, you know, again, also you have to understand, I am a contractor. I'm not an architect. I don't have the manpower or the resources to deal with submitting permits and getting permits approved and then dealing with architects and dealing with drafting companies and going back and forth. I don't have the manpower and the overhead, you know, to deal with all of that. And then the time suck and the red tape and all this stuff that comes with that. And so I did that as a favor to Mirza and because it was required as a condition of the loan. And also another thing that you have to understand is that I had initially given Mirza a quote of maybe 160,000 or something and he came back and he said, that's too much. And for whatever reason, I made a stupid mistake and I lowered my price. And when I lowered my price, I lowered it to right above where I thought my overhead and you know, a little bit of profit might have been. And now I'm realizing that there's no profit and there might not even be enough for overhead. And so, and then on top of that, there was a lot of changes and, you know, that were not documented in the original contract. And so when those changes were coming about, I had assured him that, you know, I'll take care of whatever he wanted to do. We had discussed some ballpark numbers and they were okay with those ballpark numbers. And then when I had, you know, it was my fault. I should have sent change orders immediately, but I didn't have the structure in place to be able to do that. And I sent all the change orders at once after we got to a tipping point and, you know, he didn't agree with all of the change orders. And he thought that it was way more than what we had originally agreed on. And then, on top of that, he is Even after all of this, even after he's complaining about, you know, all the price increases and all that stuff, you know, I was having problems with my, you know, personally. And so I was having issues financially. I, you know, wasn't able to keep up with all of the stuff going on. My staff that I had tried to put in place, you know, the virtual assistants that I had hired in the Philippines, they all quit. And pretty much, you know, all of the effects of ADHD burnout had started catching up to me and I was starting to get burnt out. And, you know, and then, you know, all of his issues were just too much for me. And so I understand that the problem was probably could have been mitigated with some communication. But the other issue is that, you know, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. And he's like, hey, we need to, he wants, like, for example, he's complaining on the other hand, on one hand, that we are under budget, or sorry, we're over budget. You know, initially I'd given him a quote too much. I gave him a discount. And, you know, then we're okay. Now, then they start doing change orders. They go on Facebook marketplace, they start buying their own tile. And then they start buying their own used windows, they want to put windows here, they want to put windows there. Fine, I did all of that. And then, you know, now, even after I give them all of the change orders, and he's completely shocked with the total of the change orders, he starts asking me about, hey, can we do heated floors in the master bathroom? Like, dude, what the hell? Like, how are you complaining about the change orders, the process, all this stuff, and then you're still asking about, like, heated floors? How does that make sense? So, and then I told him straight up, like, because he is my acquaintance, because he's an acquaintance, because I viewed him as a friend. And, you know, he started bringing other people in from that I knew into the situation. And I told him, look, I broke down everything. Very truthfully, I told him I don't have any money. And I was moving this project forward by, you know, from pulling money from other projects, I don't have the ability to do that anymore. And his money was, he had paid some out of pocket, which he had paid all of it. And then he had, the rest of the money was supposed to come from his lender, the 203k lender. But the problem is, the 203k lender, they have a scope of work that doesn't reflect what the actual scope of work is. And so the draws aren't conducive with what the work is being done. And then also, when they issue funds, they have a holdback of 10%. And I already don't have any money. And so, and they're only issuing funds after the work has been done, which means I have to front the money in the first place to do the work. And so this whole thing doesn't, doesn't work. I mean, it was a mistake for me to ever do this in the first place. And I did it because it, I didn't realize the amount of red tape that was going to be involved dealing with the village. Or sorry, dealing with the county. I told him up front, very clearly, I don't deal with permits. I don't deal with plans. All that stuff is, is done up front. I come in, I knock out the work. And if that was the case, we wouldn't have been in the situation. And then on top of that, the issue is with the 203k lender is that because he did that, then we now have to pull a permit. And now we have all of the, those issues. If from the beginning, what he had done was, because he had the budget, he had like $90,000 that he could have just paid out of pocket. He should have just went and got a conventional loan, or even a hard money lender, which I told him in the first place. Go get a hard money loan, buy this house, fix it, just paint and flooring, whatever the bare minimum you want to do is, which is what your plan was. And then go and refinance, move in, and then refinance and save your money. And you would have been, he would have been moved into the house, eight months ago. And then after all of this, he said, okay, I understand your situation. I understand you're overwhelmed. If you need any help from me, let me know. I'll help you all of this. I told him, what I need you to do is mark up the approved plans that we have with all of the locations of where the actual light fixtures are supposed to be. Like, you know, on the approved plans we might have over here in one room, it says, you know, 10 light fixtures, 10, 10 recessed lights, but maybe actually we're going to be putting, you know, 25. And in one room, maybe it says, you know, we're going to have, I don't know, four recessed lights, but actually there's going to be no recessed lights. There's going to be a ceiling fan. All of those details, mark them out. Send it back to me. I'll send it to Aldraft. Oh, and then we had actually, so we did the rough, we did the rough plumbing. We called for rough plumbing inspection. We called for rough plumbing inspection. The plumbing inspector came out and he started noticing all of these framing issues, which wasn't from me, wasn't any of the work that I did or my guys did. This was all of the work that has been DIY'd and the layers of DIY work over the years. And then on top of that, it was the plumber who had went through and then completely drilled out all of, you know, bigger holes. And so the combination of those two things is what caused him to notice all of this stuff. The other issue is that the first electrician I hired, he had notched out the ceiling joists in order to center the boxes and that wasn't correct. But again, that's not an issue. I could have just sistered everything and it would have been fixed. And even for repairing what this inspector had pointed out, the repair is easy. You just sister the joists and it's literally twice as strong as it would have been before. But they're like, no, no, you got to call a structural engineer. You got to call an architect. You got to get them out here. They got to look at it and we need to have a letter from them. And then we got to go based off of that. And so that's the problem with all of this stuff. And so I told him, get me the previous approved plans with the markups of all of the locations of the lights and the types of fixtures finalized. I will then take the structural engineer's report along with that markup. Marked up copy. And whatever else, send it back to the drafting company that we used. And they will make the changes and then we'll resubmit that to the county. And then you can hound the county to get them to approve it. In the meantime, We will need to agree on all of the cost increases due to, number one, increased time for handling the permitting process, increased time because because of the the way that the county has been coming back and not approving all of the work that we have been done. There's nothing wrong with the work that was done, but there's just so much rework that needed to be done that the budget has shot up because of that. For example, electrical. I had already spoken to the inspector that was going to do the electrical work. I knew exactly what needed to be done, how it needed to be handled. The problem is we had a plan in place, which was finalize the revisions, finalize it, get the structural engineers report. We submit that to ALDRAFT. They will make the changes. Then we submit that to the county. In the meantime, we figure out the financial situation and then we can move forward. But we didn't do that. I told him clearly that that's what needs to be done, but he decided to start calling his electrical engineer, different electrical subcontractors on his own. He was like, we need to get the framing done. So I listened to him. I got the framing done. He brought in somebody that I knew that we had a mutual contact. I told him that this is going to get messy. He was like, no. I let him do whatever he wanted to do. This guy's giving one direction and then he's doing his own thing. What the hell am I supposed to do? I just stepped back and let him do whatever he wants to do. This is where we end up. We're still at the same point a month later. We still have to do exactly what I told him we needed to do is submit, give me the changes, the revisions. We need to submit them to ALDRAFT and then submit those to the county. And then me and you need to agree on the financial aspect, the change orders, the increased work because of the increased amount of time from dealing with the county, the increased amount of time from all the revisions that we had to deal with. All of that stuff wasn't documented and wasn't accounted for in the original bid. And I'm already losing my ass on this project because I had given him a price that I would have made a little bit of money on, which was $160,000. And that still didn't include all of those. Maybe there was some contingency in there. And now at the price that I lowered it to $120,000, there's absolutely no contingency. And there's all these cost overruns. And so these need to be accounted for. If you don't want to account for these, then you can find somebody else. And so the money that he has paid up until this point is because of the rework, because of cost overruns, because of having to deal with the county. For example, my original bid for plumbing was about $5,000. That did not include. Then when we had to submit to the county, they required so many other increases. Like we needed a floor drain in the basement. We need a floor drain in the basement, then you need an ejector pump and an ejector pit. Well, there's no ejector pit. So now we need to add an ejector pit. That wasn't included in the original bid. We were not going to touch the plumbing in the existing hall bathroom. But it's all not up to code. And the plumber needs to pass the plumbing inspection. And he needs to tie the master bathroom, which connects to the hall bathroom and redo all of that plumbing so naturally now the plumbing bit has increased and that wasn't accounted for so it's all these different things and then on top of that this guy just keeps blowing up my phone constantly and if i don't answer that means i'm not i told him i'm not feeling good i am exhausted he's not listening to me he's doing his own thing i have other personal shit that i need to deal with how can i take care of you if i can't take care of myself first and you're blowing up my phone constantly does that make sense and then on top of that he starts calling other people he starts calling my former business partner he starts calling my wife i don't even know where he got that number that's absolutely freaking unacceptable i don't want to deal with this person anymore and if i do deal with him then i need to set hard boundaries and i need your help doing that. So, analyze all of this stream of consciousness that I'm telling you, and help me make a plan on how to move forward with this."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"9147e25d0e52eacc-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cf30f9b3-9891-4dd4-894e-839fe5e2d57d","children":["cb403b7c-7cba-4af6-a4c2-8a43e89b9146"]},"cb403b7c-7cba-4af6-a4c2-8a43e89b9146":{"id":"cb403b7c-7cba-4af6-a4c2-8a43e89b9146","message":{"id":"cb403b7c-7cba-4af6-a4c2-8a43e89b9146","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739985278.677218,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["## **Analysis of 28W500 Kenwood Project & Action Plan to Move Forward**\n\n### **Summary of the Situation**\nThe **28W500 Kenwood** project is a client project under **Windy City Construction** for **Mirza Baig**, an acquaintance connected to your social network.

Changes were made without proper documentation, leading to **disputes over change orders and unexpected costs**. \n\nAdditionally, Mirza Baig has been:\n- **Micromanaging** while **not following the agreed-upon plan**.\n- **Bringing in third parties** without coordination.\n- **Making impulsive requests (heated floors, new windows, etc.)** despite cost complaints.\n- **Blowing up your phone and contacting people outside of work** (including your wife).\n- **Refusing to acknowledge the true financial and time impact of dealing with the county**.\n\nMeanwhile, you:\n- **Did not document change orders early enough**.\n- **Took on too much responsibility with permits and approvals** despite not offering those services.\n- **Are financially drained**, unable to front costs, and cannot keep the project moving without **his cooperation**.\n\n### **What Needs to Happen Now**\nYou need to **establish firm boundaries** and **reset expectations** so you don’t continue hemorrhaging time, energy, and money. This means:\n1. **Drawing a Clear Line Between Scope & Additional Costs**  \n2. **Setting Firm Communication Rules**  \n3. **Ensuring Accountability on His Part**  \n4. **Finalizing Plans & Permits Before Any More Work is Done**  \n5. **Refusing to Move Forward Without a Financial Agreement**  \n\n---\n\n# **Step-by-Step Action Plan**\n\n## **1. Immediate Boundaries & Communication Rules**\nFirst, **you cannot let Mirza Baig continue his chaotic, reactionary approach**. His lack of planning is costing you time and money. You need to establish **firm boundaries**:\n\n### **A. Communication Protocol**\n- **No more personal calls/texts at random hours**. Only communicate through **email and scheduled calls**.  \n- **All messages must be consolidated into one email per day** (if needed).  \n- **No more contacting third parties (your wife, business partners, subcontractors) without your explicit permission**.  \n- **He cannot introduce new subcontractors without prior discussion**.  \n- **No change orders will be discussed over the phone**—everything in writing.  \n\n**→ Implementation:**  \nSend him a professional email stating:  \n> \"Effective immediately, all project communications will be handled through email. We will set a time for weekly check-ins, and any urgent matters will be addressed in writing first. This ensures clarity and avoids miscommunication.\"\n\n---\n\n## **2. Financial Reconciliation & Change Orders Agreement**\nYou are already **in the red** on this project. Before moving forward:  \n- **Tally up the cost overruns and additional work.**  \n- **Create a document outlining the original scope vs. the actual work done.**  \n- **Specify what was not included in the original bid but became necessary due to county requirements.**  \n- **List the revised project total, breaking down where the extra costs came from.**  \n\n**→ Implementation:**  \nSchedule a formal meeting (in-person or Zoom) where you:  \n1. **Present the financial breakdown professionally**.  \n2. **Clearly state that you will not move forward without an agreement on covering the cost overruns.**  \n3. **Make it clear that without additional payment, you will need to stop work.**  \n4. **Require a signed acknowledgment of change orders before continuing.**  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Finalize Plans & Permits – No More Work Without Approval**\nOne of the biggest mistakes in this project was **not locking in the final plans before starting work**.  \n\n### **What Needs to Happen:**  \n- **He needs to mark up the approved plans with all fixture locations.**  \n- **You send the marked-up plans to ALDRAFT for final revisions.**  \n- **Once ALDRAFT updates the plans, submit them to the county.**  \n- **No work resumes until the county approves the revised plans.**  \n\n**→ Implementation:**  \nSend him a formal written request:  \n> \"I cannot proceed further until the approved plans reflect all current fixture locations and structural modifications. You need to complete the markups as discussed. Once those are finalized, I will submit them to ALDRAFT and then to the county. Until we have county approval, no further work will be done.\"\n\n**Firm stance:** If he delays, that’s on him. Do not let him rush you into working without approved plans.\n\n---\n\n## **4. No More Work Until Funding Is Secured**\nThe **203k lender’s disbursement structure is broken**—it requires you to **front costs** you cannot afford. **This is not sustainable**.  \n\n### **What Needs to Happen:**  \n- He must **pay upfront for upcoming work or secure alternative financing**.  \n- If he refuses, **you will not continue the project.**  \n- **You need a revised payment structure based on real costs, not the lender's flawed draw schedule.**  \n\n**→ Implementation:**  \nDraft a written statement:  \n> \"Due to the current financial structure of the project, I cannot continue work unless we agree on a new payment schedule that ensures materials and labor are covered in advance. The current 203k loan structure does not align with the actual work requirements, and I cannot continue to front costs.\"\n\n---\n\n## **5. Exit Strategy (If Needed)**\nIf he refuses to cooperate or continues to ignore boundaries, you need a **graceful exit plan** to avoid further losses.\n\n### **Possible Exit Paths:**  \n- **Negotiate a settlement**: Offer to **step away for a fee** to compensate for the time spent.  \n- **Have him find another contractor**: He will likely struggle to find someone who will take over at the same cost.  \n- **Lien the property (if necessary)**: If he refuses to pay for completed work, you may have grounds to file a **mechanic's lien** for unpaid labor and materials.  \n\n---\n\n# **Final Summary**\n## **What You Need to Do Next**\n1. **Set Clear Boundaries & Enforce Communication Rules** – No more micromanaging or personal calls.  \n2. **Require Agreement on Change Orders & Financials Before Continuing Work** – Show him a breakdown of cost overruns.  \n3. **Ensure All Plans & Permits Are Finalized Before Continuing Work** – No more work without county approval.  \n4. **Refuse to Continue Work Without a Secure Payment Plan** – You will not front costs anymore.  \n5. **Be Prepared to Exit If Necessary** – Do not let this project drag you further into debt.  \n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n- **You are not obligated to fix his financial mistakes.**  \n- **You need to enforce strong business policies to avoid future chaos.**  \n- **The 203k loan was the root problem—he ignored your advice, and now he’s paying the price.**  \n- **If he continues ignoring your plan, cut your losses and move on.**  \n\nWould you like me to draft any emails or formal documents to put these plans into motion?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"d99b0777-0d2a-4693-aa3d-02f29006ccaf","request_id":"9147e25d0e52eacc-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d99b0777-0d2a-4693-aa3d-02f29006ccaf","children":["3689af9f-8149-4562-8005-1639fef5e68d"]},"3689af9f-8149-4562-8005-1639fef5e68d":{"id":"3689af9f-8149-4562-8005-1639fef5e68d","message":{"id":"3689af9f-8149-4562-8005-1639fef5e68d","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739985446.548384,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How should I start implementing this plan?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"9147e90db803ead2-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cb403b7c-7cba-4af6-a4c2-8a43e89b9146","children":["acc0e502-22b2-4378-8105-0fc3facb2545"]},"acc0e502-22b2-4378-8105-0fc3facb2545":{"id":"acc0e502-22b2-4378-8105-0fc3facb2545","message":{"id":"acc0e502-22b2-4378-8105-0fc3facb2545","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739985528.512493,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["## **How to Start Implementing This Plan – Step-by-Step Execution**\nTo regain control over the **28W500 Kenwood Project**, you need to take **immediate action** in a structured way. The best way to proceed is to **set boundaries, demand financial clarity, finalize plans, and enforce accountability**. Here’s how to **start implementing this plan today**.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Immediate Communication & Resetting Expectations**\n### **A. Draft and Send a Firm Email**\nYour first step is to **officially reset expectations in writing**. This email should:\n1. **Acknowledge the current state of the project.**  \n2. **Establish clear rules for communication going forward.**  \n3. **Define the exact steps needed before work can continue.**  \n4. **State that work will not resume until finances and plans are settled.**  \n\n### **→ Draft Email:**\n**Subject:** Urgent: Next Steps & Requirements for 28W500 Kenwood Project  \n\nHi Mirza,  \n\nI want to clarify the current status of the project and ensure we are aligned on the next steps. Given the challenges we’ve faced, I need to **reset expectations** to move forward in an efficient and structured manner.  \n\n### **Project Status & Immediate Next Steps**  \n1. **Finalized Plans & County Approval** – Before any further work, we need to submit final, revised plans to the county for approval. You need to mark up the plans with all actual fixture locations and types. Once complete, I will send them to ALDRAFT for revisions and then submit them to the county. No work can resume until the county signs off.  \n2. **Financial Agreement on Change Orders & Additional Costs** – Due to unforeseen permit requirements and code compliance issues, the cost of work has increased significantly. We need to formally agree on change orders before proceeding further. A breakdown of these costs will be provided.  \n3. **Updated Payment Terms** – The current **203k loan disbursement structure is not working**, as it requires me to front costs, which is unsustainable. We must establish an alternative payment structure where materials and labor are covered upfront.  \n\n### **New Communication Protocol (Effective Immediately)**  \n- All project discussions must take place via **email** to ensure clarity and documentation.  \n- Phone calls will be scheduled **only when necessary**—no more unscheduled calls or messages.  \n- No third parties (such as my family, former business partners, or other contractors) should be contacted regarding this project.  \n\nUntil the **finalized plans** are submitted to the county and we reach an **agreement on financials**, **all work on the project is on hold**. I want to resolve this as efficiently as possible, but I cannot continue without these critical steps being addressed.  \n\nLet me know once you have marked up the plans so I can proceed with ALDRAFT.  \n\nBest,  \nMirza  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Prepare Financial Breakdown & Change Order Summary**\n- **Compile a list of all additional work done beyond the original contract**.\n- **Itemize the additional costs**—this includes:\n  - Permit-related requirements (structural fixes, plumbing modifications, etc.).\n  - Change orders he requested (windows, heated floors, extra lighting, etc.).\n  - Time and labor overruns due to county delays.\n- **Calculate the new project total** and determine what is unpaid.\n- **Decide on payment terms**—whether he needs to pay an upfront lump sum or establish a revised draw schedule.\n\n### **→ Action Item: Create a Financial Breakdown Document**\n- I can help you **format this into a professional invoice-style document** if needed.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Stop Work and Enforce the Plan**\nAfter you send the email, **do not respond to any calls or texts unless they comply with the new communication rules**. If he ignores your email and continues calling/texting:\n- Politely **remind him via text**:  \n  > \"As per my last email, all communication will be handled through email moving forward. Please review the email and respond there.\"  \n\nIf he **ignores the financial requirements** and tries to pressure you into continuing work:\n- Stand firm:  \n  > \"Work cannot proceed until the financials are settled and plans are finalized. Let me know when you are ready to move forward per the agreed terms.\"  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Submit Finalized Plans to ALDRAFT & County**\n- Once he **marks up the plans**, **submit them to ALDRAFT** for revision.\n- When **ALDRAFT completes the changes**, submit the revised plans to the **county for approval**.\n- No work resumes until **county approval is received**.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Finalize Financial Agreement Before Resuming Work**\n- Once he **reviews the cost breakdown**, get **written confirmation** that he agrees to the change orders.\n- Establish a **payment schedule** that allows you to proceed **without fronting costs**.\n- Ensure **a payment is made before restarting work**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Contingency Plan (Exit Strategy)**\nIf he **refuses to cooperate** or continues making unreasonable demands:\n- **Give him the option to find another contractor**.\n- **Negotiate a fair exit settlement** where you receive payment for work completed.\n- If necessary, **lien the property** for unpaid work.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Implementation Checklist**\n### **Today**\n✅ Draft & send the email resetting expectations  \n✅ Compile a financial breakdown & list of change orders  \n✅ Stop answering non-email communication  \n\n### **This Week**\n✅ Get his marked-up plans and submit them to ALDRAFT  \n✅ Establish a final payment agreement before resuming work  \n✅ Submit revised plans to the county  \n\n---\n\nThis plan **puts you back in control** and **forces him to take responsibility**.

Project Overview**\n- **Project Name:** 28W500 Kenwood Avenue  \n- **Type:** Client project under **Windy City Construction**  \n- **Client Name:** Mirza Baig  \n- **Relationship:**  \n  - Acquaintance from prior to Windy City Construction  \n  - Not particularly close, but known for a long time  \n  - Connected through mutual friends and relatives  \n- **Project Type:**  \n  - **203k Renovation Loan Project** (lender-funded renovation)  \n  - Initially intended as a **light renovation for the client’s family home**  \n  - Escalated due to **permit requirements and county regulations**  \n- **Initial Client Plan:**  \n  - Buy the house  \n  - Do **minimal work**  \n  - Move his family in as soon as possible  \n  - Use **203k renovation loan** for the renovation  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Property Details**\n- **Year Built:** ~1960  \n- **Unincorporated Area:** Falls under county jurisdiction rather than a local village  \n- **History of Work Done:**  \n  - **Little to no permit history** between original build and today  \n  - At some point, the house was converted into a **religious use property (church, etc.)**  \n  - Likely a **permit pulled at that time**, but nothing in between  \n  - Over decades, **multiple DIY renovations and additions** with **subpar workmanship**  \n  - By the time Mirza Baig bought it, it was in the **middle of an unpermitted DIY renovation**  \n- **Ownership History Prior to Purchase:**  \n  - Previous owners were **in foreclosure**  \n  - Divorce situation added complications  \n- **Condition at Purchase:**  \n  - Numerous **structural, plumbing, and electrical issues**  \n  - Extensive **unpermitted, non-code-compliant work**  \n  - Work was **\"garbage on top of garbage\"**  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Major Challenges & Issues**\n### **A. 203k Renovation Loan Requirements**\n- **Lender required a permit to be pulled** before any funds were released.  \n- **Pulling a permit triggered additional compliance issues**, forcing the entire house to be brought up to **modern code**.  \n- **Additional county involvement** introduced red tape that **dramatically increased the budget**.  \n\n### **B. County Regulations & Inspections**\n- Unlike village inspections (which are often more flexible), **the county required strict adherence to plans**.  \n- **Inspectors insisted that all work matched the plans exactly**, no matter how minor the deviation.  \n- **County inspectors required plans to be on-site for all inspections.**  \n- Any changes (even minor ones) **needed to be reflected in the approved plans**, causing delays.  \n\n### **C. Scope Creep & Lack of Documentation**\n- **Initial estimate:** ~$160,000  \n- **Client thought it was too high**, so you **lowered your price** to **$120,000**.  \n- **New price left no contingency for overages**, resulting in **zero profit** and **potential losses**.  \n- Client kept making **unofficial changes** without formal documentation.  \n- Change orders were not sent immediately due to **lack of internal systems**, leading to **large batch invoicing later**, which **shocked the client**.  \n\n### **D. Financial & Cash Flow Problems**\n- **Project funding was delayed due to lender's draw schedule.**  \n- **Lender’s draw schedule did not align with actual work progress.**  \n- Lender **withheld 10% retainage**, forcing you to **front costs**.  \n- Due to financial struggles, you were **moving money from other projects** to keep this one going.  \n- Eventually, **you could no longer cover costs**, leading to a work stoppage.  \n\n### **E. Client Behavior & Issues**\n- **Lacked understanding of construction processes and costs**.  \n- Constantly **called and messaged excessively**, even outside working hours.  \n- **Bought materials from Facebook Marketplace** (used windows, tile, etc.), complicating work.  \n- **Changed plans frequently** while simultaneously **complaining about the cost.**  \n- After receiving the large batch of change orders, he **complained about price increases** yet still asked for luxury features (**heated floors, additional windows, etc.**).  \n- **Did not respect professional boundaries** (e.g., contacting your wife and business associates).  \n- **Brought in third-party subcontractors** without consulting you first.  \n- **Ignored your recommendations**, such as using a **hard money loan instead of a 203k loan**, which could have **saved him time and money**.  \n\n### **F. Inspection & Structural Issues**\n- **Plumbing Inspector Noticed Framing Issues**  \n  - These were **not from your work** but **from previous DIY work** and the **plumber’s oversized holes**.  \n  - **Ceiling joists were improperly notched** by the first electrician.  \n  - Repairs (sistering joists) were easy but **county required a structural engineer’s report** before approving fixes.  \n\n- **Structural Engineer Requirement Delayed Progress**  \n  - You told Mirza Baig to mark up plans with **fixture locations and final revisions**.  \n  - These needed to be sent to **ALDRAFT for plan revisions** and then submitted to **the county**.  \n  - **He did not follow through, delaying the process further.**  \n\n---\n\n## **4. Current Status of the Project**\n- **Project is stalled** because:\n  1. **Revised plans with final fixture locations have not been submitted.**  \n  2. **County has not approved updated plans.**  \n  3. **Financial agreement on cost increases is not in place.**  \n  4. **You are not in a financial position to continue fronting work.**  \n- **Next Steps Required for Progress:**\n  1. **Mirza Baig must finalize plan markups** and return them to you.  \n  2. **Plans must be sent to ALDRAFT for updates.**  \n  3. **Revised plans must be submitted to the county.**  \n  4. **A new financial agreement must be signed before work resumes.**  \n\n---\n\n## **5. Key Mistakes & Lessons Learned**\n### **Mistakes**\n✅ **Lowered price too much** – Set yourself up for failure.  \n✅ **Did not send immediate change orders** – Led to disputes.  \n✅ **Agreed to handle permitting when it wasn’t your responsibility** – Created additional burden.  \n✅ **Underestimated county regulations** – Assumed it would be similar to village inspections.  \n✅ **Fronted too many costs** – Relied on lender draws that weren’t structured properly.  \n✅ **Did not enforce communication boundaries early on** – Allowed client to be overly demanding.  \n\n### **Lessons Learned**\n🔹 **Never agree to handle permits unless properly compensated.**  \n🔹 **Never lower your bid beyond profitability just to win a project.**  \n🔹 **Require upfront payment or milestone-based payments that align with actual costs.**  \n🔹 **Send change orders immediately, not in bulk later.**  \n🔹 **Avoid working on 203k renovation loans unless they are structured properly.**  \n🔹 **Establish communication protocols at the beginning of the project.**  \n🔹 **If a client is disorganized, enforce clear guidelines before starting.**  \n\n---\n\n## **6. Current Next Steps to Fix the Project**\n### **Immediate Actions**\n1. **Send a firm email resetting expectations** (stop random calls, require written communication).  \n2. **Require financial reconciliation before resuming work** (present detailed breakdown).  \n3. **Enforce plan finalization** (require him to submit marked-up changes before resubmitting to ALDRAFT).  \n4. **Do not continue work until county permits are approved and payment is structured properly.**  \n\n### **Possible Exit Plan**\n- **If he refuses to cooperate, negotiate a settlement or step away.**  \n- **If necessary, place a mechanic’s lien on the property for unpaid work.**  \n\n---\n\nThis is **everything you’ve told me about the project**, broken down into a structured summary. Let me know how you want to move forward or if you need documents/templates drafted to put this plan into motion."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"7166dda2-0404-4757-ad03-7570054bcbbc","request_id":"91489de5b964540f-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7166dda2-0404-4757-ad03-7570054bcbbc","children":["ac5438fc-20a2-46b3-aa40-b7d46bf90a0e"]},"ac5438fc-20a2-46b3-aa40-b7d46bf90a0e":{"id":"ac5438fc-20a2-46b3-aa40-b7d46bf90a0e","message":{"id":"ac5438fc-20a2-46b3-aa40-b7d46bf90a0e","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740008505.995463,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The following is a transcript of a phone call that I had with my uncle who is one of the people that he brought in the middle of this:\n\nYeah, so he had scheduled that guy, remember when you and I, the three of us had first talked way back when and we were at the house? Uh-huh. He had scheduled him then to come out, assuming all the work would have been done. That's when he scheduled the guy. I know, but it that wasn't even going to be possible because That I don’t even know, dude. we have to rewire the Yeah, I mean, that's fine, but whatever. Yeah, I told him, I'm like, \"You understand you kind of shot yourself in the foot now. Because all the stuff that wasn’t up to code has to be now brought up to code.\" So, here's what I told him. I go, \"Sit down with him.\" I go, \"Meet at the house one more time. If you want, I can come out there um figure out what day it is. But, let's go there. Figure out all the things that need to be updated on the plans. And then Ib will give it to his guy, get all the things updated on the plans. Once all the plans are updated with all the changes that you have to make, including getting the stuff up to code that wasn't up to code when you bought the house, get all this up up-to-date on the plans, submit the plans. Once the village says, 'Okay, you know what? Everything looks good,' I go, then go find your own guys, cut Ibrahim loose.\" That That's fine. If he wants to do that, I would be more than happy to to do that. Now, the problem is, this is exactly what I told him that we needed to do a month ago. I'll be before before he pinged me up. Yes. I Yes, I was having my own shit going on. I, you know, all this other stuff. Yes. exactly That's funny. Um all you know, all this other stuff, and he asked me, \"Okay.\" Like, and I appreciated it, and I told him, \"Look.\" He was like, \"How can I help you?\" I said, \"What you can do is\" Because at the point, where, like, I'd like this was, like, affecting me, and, like, I had stopped replying cuz I just couldn't handle it. We were supposed to I had told him the plan, which was, I need all of the revisions. I had already met with the same guy right after I met with the structural engineer. I met with the structural engineer, I told him what needed to be done. He then sent me back a uh you know, his his drawing, like, 2 weeks after he told me he was going to send it back to me. He told me it was going to take, like, a 3 days, and then he forgot. Um but then he and he he got that to me. And then I also met with the uh uh what's it called? The inspector. And I got the direction from him already. I This is why I knew that we needed to um adjust the plans with exactly the type of light fixtures, the number of light fixtures, you know, like, if there's a soffit here, like, whatever else needs to be done. I mean, I already knew it exactly. Everything that needs to be done, I told him. And I explained this to him. We had a plan, and we were following that plan. That's is is the problem is I don't know where that deviated. And, you know, then he brought you in. That's fine. Uh I'm not I don't care. So, Well, here here Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. So So So, okay. I I just want to clarify. The reason I got brought in was because in our basketball group Yeah, yeah. He sent a message Yeah. He sent a message looking for other people. He He sent out a message saying, \"Hey, does anybody have a construction company?\" Yeah. and my girl, I'm like, \"Oh yeah, I know two people. I know you.\" And then the other guy I know is Shaq. Uh but Shaq does a lot of commercial projects, like gas stations, remodels, or, like, restaurants. Wait, the same Shaq? Huh? The same Shaq? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Our um workout guy, Shifu. Really? Yeah. Hmm. Uh okay. So So, yeah. So, anyways, now I know I know that. I I I know that, like, I know how that happened. Yeah. Yeah, so then I go, I'm like, \"Yeah, I know two guys.\" I go, \"Look, first, you can talk to my nephew. He'll get it done. And if he's too busy and he's tied up, then, you know, we we can go to Shaq.\" Well, but I know Shaq's busy building out a bunch of restaurants right now. And um and then he goes, \"Okay, that's cool.\" And I'm like, \"Well,\" I go, he goes, \"Can you meet me at the place?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, sure. Let me go look at it.\" So, I went to go look at it. And I didn't know what your place was called. Um and then he's and I said, you know, \"The guy's name is Ibrahim. He's a really good guy,\" blah, blah, and he goes, \"Ibrahim from uh Windy City Construction?\" And I was like, \"Oh no, no. You don't want to\" But so, you know the background on Windy City Construction, right? No. So, there's a guy named Mahmoud and Sameer. They own Windy City Construction, but they use Windy City Construction to launder money. Um if you go through Gables Hills or Bridgeview area, right by, I think, Baba's Saj is a beard, haircut, barbershop. Okay. He does a lot of other things there. He sells weapons, he sells pot, cocaine, you name it. And, I mean, he's got three P wagons. You don't get three BP wagons cutting hair all the time. So, he opened up Windy City Construction and he has 1,000 pissed off customers. But, what he'll do is he'll go in and he'll he'll start some work somewhere. And do the same thing, like, you know, the the job is, let's say, $100,000. They'll give him $5,000 up front, and then he never finishes the job, but he claims, \"Hey, I got $100,000 from doing this job.\" Cuz his job his goal isn't to finish the work, it's just to get the work started so he can show on paperwork that the contracts he's getting are worth this much, but he never finishes any of them. Mhm. He's with Windy City Construction. Got it. Yeah. So, that's what I said, I'm like, \"No, no, no.\" I go, \"Ibrahim's something else,\" probably, like, Khan Construction or something like that. And then And then we were going through it, and I'm like, \"Oh yeah, that is him. Okay. Yeah, I don't know the name of his company, but, yeah, it sounds like it's him.\" So, that's how this whole thing got started. Yeah, yeah. No, I know. Yeah. Yeah. I I get that. So, but that's fine. But, the problem is uh at this point Yeah, okay. And then also um I mean, yeah, if this guy like if I don't answer, like, this guy will just keep calling. And it's not about, like at first, it was like, \"Okay, I was busy. Like, I was doing something else. I can't answer your call right now. Like, just send me a text message, and I'll get back to you.\" But then, like, when he keeps calling, I don't want to freaking like you know, get back to this guy if he's going to, like I don't know, like, act like this. Um anyways, so I get it. I get it. um yeah. So, initially um I don’t remember where I was going. But I can start from, you know I mean, yeah, I mean I don't know how long you've known him, but I I've known him as an acquaintance uh for a long time. Like, probably I I I have known him for uh 1 year um ever since I started playing basketball with those guys. Yeah, no. I mean, I've I've known him um as an acquaintance again, like, not not close. But, we used to ride together, like, maybe 15 years ago or something like that. Okay. Um so, yeah. So, again, his initial plan was, like, we had discussed yesterday, buy the house, do minimal work, move in as soon as possible. But, the problem was he used his 203(k) loan for the renovation. And uh there was little to no permit history between, like, the original build and today, right? And the house was built in 1960. And you can obviously tell how many times it's been expanded on and um you know, additions and all this stuff. And who knows what was actually permitted before and what wasn't permitted uh throughout those years? And so, Well, it's unincorporated DuPage County. Yeah. I'm willing to bet that nothing was permitted before. No, I mean But there was some permitted stuff because at that Like, in the middle, um it was being used as, like, some type of religious property, some, like, commercial thing, like, upstairs in that loft area, like, it was an office. And there was, like, an elevator shaft and all that stuff. And so, that was permitted. And so, Oh, I I I think the build-out above the garage, I think that was done with a permit. Yeah, but it was still shitty. Like, it was still completely shitty. Yeah, but Um But then, even that one, that one was like, maybe, 20 years ago. And there's been so many changes since then that have obviously not been done You know. You can do work without a permit. I don't care about pulling the permit. It's just do the work the right way. And um so, I mean, that's that's the problem. But there's so many layers to this house, and if he if we had did his original plan, move in, do a light reno, and uh without pulling a permit, I mean, we would have been done, you know, like probably 8 months ago. But, the problem was we had to pull a permit because his lender required it. Yeah. And that's where all of this started, is that uh when I had given him the initial When I even I kept asking him, \"Like, why'd you get a permit? You don't need a permit for this.\" And you're in uh uh unincorporated DuPage. Yeah. And he goes, \"That was part of his loan process.\" I'm like, \"It doesn't make any sense.\" I go, \"No bank says, 'Get a permit.'\" Yeah. I go, this is the what you want to do is just minor stuff. No one says that. Yeah. It was part of his It was part of his loan. And And that's where all these problems started, is because, initially, I had quoted him one price and to do the work. And uh you know, whatever, just get the job done. I lowered the price. My fault. And then we started going through all these issues where I, as a contractor, I'm not the one that usually does all this stuff to pull the permits and um deal with Well, I mean Fine. Pull the Pulling the permits, no problem. The problem was we don't have any plans. That's not what a contractor deals with. Right? A contractor doesn't deal with coming out, uh taking as-built measurements, um and then you know, dealing with the So, some some of them do. Yeah, I mean, if you if you have a design-build you know firm, if you have that process in place, right? Then, yeah, I mean Fine, no problem. I know, you know, all that stuff. But, I told him upfront, \"I don't deal with this. I am only doing this because it's required by your lender that it needs to be included in the cost.\" And that's why we had it as a line item. But, I told him upfront that I don't usually deal with this. Usually, I have plans that are ready to submit. And then, at that point, we just submit them, and we wait for an approved permit, and then we do the work. And so, I didn't consider all this extra uh overhead for actually getting the plans and then dealing with the county that was 10 times worse than dealing with any previous municipality that I've dealt with before um just in the fact that, you know, they would take forever to get back to us. Um and then, even when they did get back to us, there was a bunch of things that we would need to deal with. And this whole time, we're doing all this stuff when, you know, we're already on the clock because now he's making mortgage payments as soon as he closed, right? And so, that was the problem uh from the beginning. Yeah. And And so, No, no. I I get all that. I told him this. I'm like, \"Listen,\" I go, there is work that needs to happen. Um but I go, \"Right now, I think there is some bad blood between the two of you.\" Um \"Why don't you cut your losses on both sides?\" I go, \"Work with him, get the plans updated with you know do a walk at the property. Mock up the plans the way they need to be, and then, once they're all mocked up with all the changes that the guy needs to do, along with bringing everything that's not up to code up to code, then Ib will submit all those to the drafting company. They'll make all the changes. Then, take all those plans, submit them to the village, and, once the village signs off on it, I go, 'Cut Ibrahim loose. You go find your own contractors, bid it out three ways, get the cheapest one, and then just sit there.' You work from home, dude. I'm like, you can sit there with the wireless puck and just watch these guys get work done. I go, do that, and then you and Ibrahim have to figure out how to get the money you're owed back. Because, in my opinion, if you give He said you give He's given you $100,000. I don't think $100,000 worth of work has happened.\" So, I don't know what the place looks like, but, in my firm opinion, I don't think there's $100,000 worth of work done. So, I said, \"Figure out what he owes you later. But right now, before your wife divorces you, before your in-laws think you're a deadbeat, because this has been going on for a year, I would get it done and then figure out the rest later.\" Yeah. Uh which if he wants to do that, it's fine. It's going to cost him more, and he already knows that. Nobody's going to come and touch this project with a with, like, with a 10-ft stick. Yeah. Um That's why I told him, I go Which Which I shouldn't have done in the beginning. Um and that was my mistake because the initial plan was we just do a light reno, and he gets in there. That's why That's the only reason why I had uh even considered it. If it was anything more than that, I wouldn't have done it. And and that's that's the uh that's the problem. So, yeah. I mean, it So I I called a few of my old guys, and I explained them the situation. Dude, nobody wants to touch it. They go, \"Look, man.\" They they go, \"I don't want to go in and fix somebody else's job.\" \"No.\" I go, \"Forget it.\" Everyone's like, \"No, I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.\" Now, I'm like, \"All right, you know, let me call Shaq's guys.\" So, I called his guys, and, usually, these guys are solid. They will go to a place, they'll even rent out a hotel close by and get it knocked out in, like, a month. I mean, they're they're super fast. And half the guys said, \"Well,\" first of all, they go, \"We're not doing it because of the Trump thing right now\" and some of their friends got uh deported, as well. So they go So, these guys are in complete lockdown right now. They don't want to do any work. There was one guy, an electrician who is willing to do work, but the guy doesn't speak any English. So, that's a language problem with this guy, but, as long as everything gets explained from on the first visit, he shows up with his daughter, and then she'll translate. As long as everything is done, then he's good. Um but he's the only guy. No one else wants to touch it. Yeah. And again, I shouldn't have touched it in the first place, either. And that was my mistake. And so, it's not about but see It's not about, yes, for the other people looking at it, they don't want to deal with somebody else's work uh or somebody else um had issues. I mean, this It's, I mean, red flag on top of red flag on top of red flag. But, what how Mirsad is looking at it is that all this stuff is, like, is my fault, which, yes, there's some stuff that could have been handled better. But, the majority of the reason why we are where we are is because of how I didn't take control of the situation from the beginning and how this guy was acting. And uh that that is on me. And, mainly, it's uh you know, just like every single time something needs to get done, um you know, we got to meet at the house. And he's calling me uh constantly. He will you know, I gave him a price, he complained about it. We agreed on another price. And then all of my I gave him a breakdown of everything, which I don't do anymore. Um and then he starts going out and buying material on, like, Facebook Marketplace. And when I have that material um in the, like, in my line items, like, how the hell am I supposed to figure out, now, what needs to happen? How we're going to adjust costs? Um and then Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. But you gave him a quote and and y'all agreed on it, and then you started buying things, or it's still part of your your order, and he's going on buying stuff from Facebook Marketplace and then saying, \"Hey, you know, I bought this for $10. Give me the credit for $10 now?\" Pretty much. Yeah. And then he's like And then he's like, \"Oh, like, yeah, I know, like, you still have to make your markup.\" Like, you know, \"We can I'll give you your markup.\" But like He's just, like, has this, like, cheap mindset mentality, where he's, like, he's trying to go and get more value for That's that That's that mentality, right? That penny smart, dollar foolish. Yeah, exactly. That's That's the whole problem, is that, like, he'll buy Like, he went and bought, I don't know, a vanity that he wants to put in his master bathroom. Like, he drove like 3 hours to Indiana to go pick up this thing. And And then come and drop it off in the house. And I'm like, \"Okay,\" Like uh I had a price for a vanity in my quote. Now how do we deal with that? Uh you know, so So, like, it's all this stuff. Um and then so, yeah. So, I mean So, now, then I have to go and and uh and I shouldn't have let that happen. I should have just been like, \"No. Here are the tile Here are the tiles that you have to choose from, and this is what we're sticking to.\" But, I made an exception, which was my mistake. I should have never done that from the beginning. If it was anybody else, I would never let them do that. If it was some, you know If there was some client that I didn't have any previous relationship with, I would have been like, \"Hell no.\" Like, \"Here are the lists.\" Like, \"Here\" Yeah. And that's what I normally Yeah, you you build it into your quote. Right? \"Okay, these are the five tiles that you get.\" Exactly. If you don't like these tiles, this is the allowance I'll give you, and then you can go buy whatever you want from somewhere else, but this is the allowance you'll get for not getting the tiles through me. That's what I've done in the past. And for some things, it works. For other people, like, \"Yeah, you know, it's not worth it. I'll just go do whatever I want, right?\" So, I'm like, I go Yeah, but even But even that, I could just be like, \"No.\" Like, \"These are the tiles that you have to choose from. If you want to choose other tiles, fine.\" But, the problem is now, if he chooses other tiles, I can't warranty that. They're used tiles that he bought on Facebook Marketplace. If something happens to it, if my tile guy comes, starts installing them, and, you know, says like, \"Oh, look. There's this problem,\" I would have We had We yeah. We had those issues before. Yeah. And so, what they were doing was, like, I had I had a house that we were doing, and they bought a bunch of crap from uh uh What was that place that went out of business from my house? HOBO. Yeah. They bought a bunch of stuff from HOBO and everything was fine, but they didn't include that 10% Yeah, 10% overage, yeah. All that stuff. Yeah. So, we ran out of tiles. Yeah. And now, the tile doesn't exist anymore. I go, \"My guy's saying they ran out of tiles. Where's the other tiles?\" They go, \"No. Everything we have is there.\" Yeah. And the guy's like, \"No, no, no. He must have stolen it.\" I was like, \"What are you guys talking about?\" Yeah. So, we go there, and they count the tiles, and the guys are, like, \"This is the scrap that you have. And he did a pretty good job of maintaining cuts.\" And, lucky for these guys, he started in the middle of the family room and started tiling outward. Yeah, so now you can make a border. And yeah. And then And then they go, \"Oh.\" And then we went to, like, 10 HOBOs. No one had them. And then, everything at the shop because they weren’t the same tiles, we didn't do work for, like, 2, maybe, 3 weeks. And then the guy's like, \"Dude, no one makes a tile anymore. You need to go find them.\" I'm like, \"Nope. These were your five tiles that we gave you.\" Yep. Now, this is it. You guys wanted to go off and get your own, you need to supply it. Yeah. And then he's like, \"Okay, well, we'll just go with yours.\" I'm like, \"No, no, no. Tiling is now out of my budget.\" Yeah. I already gave you the credit for it. You guys are on your own. I don't care what you do and where you get it from, but you need to supply tile for the rest of the place, and we're not going to finish working until that's done. So, then they're trying to strong-arm this and that. The one guy has someone who does something for something. Eventually, he goes back to um the Kane County clerk house. And I'm, like, \"All right, you can get them involved. We have a contract. Do whatever you want. The longer you go, the longer this is going to take.\" Yep. I go, \"I already gave you the allowance for the tiles. You need to go find it now.\" Mhm. And then, eventually, he's like, \"All right, you know what?\" They will And then I think they just got a a big shipment from Lowe's, and it's somewhat matched. But, we not not to be a complete dick, I go, \"All right, you know what? We'll we'll put a perimeter around it with brown tile\" You know, they make these new tiles that look like wood. Yeah. I mean, they've been doing that for a long time. Yeah. I go I go, you know, \"Back then, they weren't.\" Uh so, I go, \"Look, they they make these tiles that look just like hardwood. I go, we'll make a perimeter of that around these tiles, and then we can add the new tiles, and, yeah, it looks a little different, but it'll still look aesthetically pleasing.\" Um so, yeah. I mean, I Look, you'll always have things like that that you got to deal with, but No, but Yeah, I mean, again, you should have done that from the get-go. Exactly. My prob- My the mistake that I made was allowing that to happen. And so, Yeah, you know. that's the mistake that I made because I, again Well, look. You you live and learn, now, right? Now you you Inshallah, next job you get, you're not going to make these, you know, leniencies, and you'll you'll No, yeah, I mean, I I wouldn't Again, I already knew that I shouldn't have made those leniencies. Like I said, if it was somebody else that's a strict client, then I would have said no. The problem was I gave him some lenience because I I knew him, and that's Yeah. where all of this is stemming from, is I gave too much slack. I gave too much of a leash. And uh and this guy just, like, you know, is going crazy all with, like, you know, the buying different, you know, buying used material, um and, you know, all these change orders that were not included in the original bid, which somehow the original bid was too expensive. But then, you know, we can go through and buy stuff from Facebook Marketplace and, you know, add windows here, add windows there, you know, change this, change that. But, the original bid was too expensive, somehow. Um you know, so it's like It's all that stuff that doesn't make sense because, again, you're right, like, his mindset is is different. And And that's the problem. And so, um So, he told me He told me he was going to be at his property on Thursday nights at, like, 5:00 or something like that. 5:00 or 6:00. Mhm. Um I go, \"Okay.\" I go, \"Ping up Ib. Let him know you're going to be there. Take the set of plans with If you don't have them, print some out. Go room by room, make all the updates and changes that you need to make to it. Finalize wherever you needed lights and things like that that you needed to get done. Have Ib submit it back to his drafting company. Let them update those plans. And then, when you get those plans back, make sure all the changes you guys talked about are on those plans. And, once everything is done, submit them. And then find your own GC to do it.\" I go, \"Look, Ibrahim already pulled the permits.\" How much was was there a cost for the permits? Yeah, there was a cost for the permits. There was a cost for the drafting company. I mean, there was a cost for everything. How much was was was it for the permit fee? It was like a $1,000, $1,500, something like that. That's Yeah, that's not too bad. Uh So, he already pulled the permit. I go, \"Find another company or just find individual tradesmen.\" I go, \"You know how it works. Framing has to get done first. Once framing is done, then plumbing. Once plumbing is done, then electrical.\" Um and then insulation, and then you do your your pre-drywall inspection. Um and then, once that's done, the drywallers come in. And, usually, there was one company that just hangs the drywall, and then they bounce. Another guy comes in and does all the finishing, taping, and mudding. Um so I go So, do it that way, um and manage them individually. Yeah. I mean again, he can he can do all that, but you think he knows how it's supposed to be done. But he doesn't. And Yeah. And then uh so Again, everything was going okay. But, it was just, you know It was all these things that started to add up. Um and Yeah. Sorry about that. I was getting a spam call in the middle. Yeah. And I went to go hang up on them, but they hung up just when I hit it, and I hung up on you. So, yeah. Um Hey, real quick. Uh um be- before I get to uh Do you know of any better um UIs for the Pixel? I really don't like the current the the stock, generic Pixel UI. Um and I've been using the Samsung UI for, man, forever. There's um So, you're you're talking about you giving allowances that you shouldn't have given him allowances for. Yeah. Um I mean, literally, yeah. So, where are we right now? Have you spoken to him after your No, no. I'm getting to that. So, um yeah, so, basically, yeah. I I mean, literally, I gave him allowances and and, like, just too much of a leash, right? And so, um the other problem is that because it's a 203(k) loan, um the lender the the schedule of the scope of work that the lender has is different from what we're actually trying to get payments on. And so, now everything has changed from what we were supposed to do originally, um that Like, when Well, then you have to update the lender in terms of, \"Look, man, we uh we found a bunch of other things that um weren't up to code that needed to get up to code.\" So, um the scope has changed now. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so I I knew that. And I told him, \"Look. The best thing to do is uh go back to your lender\" Because when I when I had given him Like, he had had all these change orders, like install the windows, uh change the placement of the bath where the bathroom was, uh install other windows, I don't remember. There was a bunch of other stuff. Um and so, I wasn't giving him We had talked about ballpark prices, but I wasn't giving him, like, exact pricing. Um and so so then I mean, that's where the root of the problem is is that all this stuff um has, you know, the scope creep, the increased uh time that was spent, even before we started any work, dealing with the county and getting the plans submitted and getting the plans prepared, getting them to a point where they're approved. All that stuff, um and so, yeah. I mean, that's um that that's that. And then Are the Are the plans Did you pay for them, or did he pay for them? I paid for How much for the plans? Uh the final payment to AllDraft was like $2,500. But, before then, I had paid, probably, I don't know, maybe like five grand if I go back and look. I mean, altogether Altogether, it's probably about, like, $7,500-ish wrapped up in plans. Does that include the surveyor and all that jazz? Uh the as-built, yeah. The as-built uh uh getting the as-built measurements and all that stuff. Yeah, because he didn't have any as-built measurements. There was no existing plans, you know, all that stuff, right? And so, um which, again, all this stuff wasn't included in the original uh in the original bid that I gave him. Yeah. And so, that's why, when you're looking at this house from uh you know, and then he's telling you, \"Okay, well, I paid him $100,000 so far,\" and he don't see $100,000 worth of work, it's because, like, everything that's happened up to that point has been just, like, one change after another after another. Um and then the amount of rework also. For example, we had a plan for the plumbing. Uh the guys came in, they did all the plumbing work. And when the plumbing inspector came out, he started noting all these issues with the framing. Um and, again, all this stuff wasn't framing issues that he was noting that I had did. It was all framing issues that were existing previously uh previously from when, like, the previous plumbing was installed. Whoever, like, did the plumbing for the original hall bathroom upstairs and then, like, when the previous owner had run all the BX, he ran them through all the studs or all the floor joists. Um and so, like 90% of those framing issues were from, you know, old work. And so, the one that set it over the top was that we have all these other framing issues, which would have been all right. But then, when the plumber came, he had to drill his 4-in hole to run his drain line. And then, so now, you add that plus everything else that existed, and it just it wasn't uh you know, structurally Every time the plumber comes out. Yeah, exactly. So, but then, again, fine. Like, \"Okay, no problem. You just go and sister all them.\" And now you have them twice as strong as they were before. Yeah. Do you, in your contracts, do you have a clause that covers subterranean work that you can't know of unless things start getting ripped apart, and then then you find out there's all these issues? I don't Uh I don't know. I mean, you don't have X-ray vision, so you won't know something's bad until you start taking it out. Once you take it out, like, \"Oh wait, we can't do this because you guys have this and this and this wrong.\" Yeah. Right. Do you have anything like that in your contracts? Uh I do now. I have an updated I have a fully updated contract. I don't know about a year Okay. and 2 months ago or whenever this was whenever I had originally given this to him. But, yeah. Um so, yeah. I mean, so that that's um you know So then, yeah. So, when the plumber when the plumbing inspector came out, he noted all these issues. Like, fine, you want to fix them? No problem. We can just slap you know 2x4s I'm sorry. We can just slap, you know, 2x10s next to it and sister all the ones that are um you know that are damaged. But this guy was like, \"No, you need to have a structural engineer come out or an architect come out. He has to take a look at it. Then you have to resubmit the plans, and, you know, they have to be documented.\" Uh you know, and all this and then, when we submitted the plans to the county, they were like, \"Okay, well, you need a floor drain 5 ft from the water heater.\" Okay, fine. There's no floor drain there. If you want a floor drain, you need an ejector pit. There's no ejector pit. Uh and then So, again, like, now, because we are submitting a permit, even if we like even if we didn't weren't going to do that, like, that's something that we have to do no matter what because they're not going to approve the permit if we don't have that on the plans. And and then, again, so then, like, that's another thing where, like, you know, that's just digging a pit and all that stuff, ejector pump, floor drain. That's going to, like, probably double the plumbing quote that I had given him uh if not more, which it did. Um and then, on top of that, when the plumber came out, he was, like, \"Yeah, I can do all this other work, but, in order for me to actually pass inspection,\" like, \"this hall bathroom is going to have to be replumbed. The kitchen is going to have to be replumbed. Otherwise, the inspector's not going to,\" you know, \"pass this stuff.\" And replumbing the hall bathroom wasn't in the quote. Replumbing the kitchen wasn't in the quote. So, essentially, we had to replumb, like, the whole left side of the house. Um so it's just, like, things like that where, because we had to pull a permit, we had to do this work a certain way, and all this stuff just starts driving up the costs. And I had not quoted for that originally. And so, and then you compound that with this guy's mindset of, you know, like picking up a penny, stepping over a dollar, and, like, the whole thing just gets, like, blown out of proportion. And uh that's how we pretty much ended up where we are right now. And so, um yeah. And then, like, like, dude, like, this guy will I mean, I was sick. Like, I was completely out of it. Um you know, like, I couldn't Yeah. I couldn't think straight. Uh I was in bed, and I told him everything that I was going through, and he was um you know He was appreciative and all this stuff. And And then he'll just keep blowing up my phone. And uh that just, like, adds more to, like, everything else that I'm going through. Like, if I didn't pick up the first time, why would I pick up the second time? Uh like, I don't understand how, like, how he thinks that um that I would pick up the second time or the third time or the 10th time. Um you know, so it's just, like, that. And then, on top of that, somehow he found my wife's number and started calling my wife. And The wife's number? Yeah. Man, that's not cool. And then, on top of that, he found I mean, you you When I started this, me and Amir were partners, uh but now we're not anymore. Even on the uh on the LLC documentation, like, it's just my name. But Amir Amir is playing soccer with us. Yeah. And Same thing. Like, I don't know how he found Amir's name. I don't know what, but, again, like, this guy called Amir and you know, like, it's just all this other stuff. And so, uh and then bringing in other people to get, you know, other people to get quotes for electrical, uh for all this other stuff, um I mean, it's I think just the lack of respect for professional boundaries, uh bringing in other people, and, again, like, where we are now is exactly what I told him needed to be done a month ago. And for whatever reason, he we didn't do that, which is what I told him. Like, I told him we need to I need you to write and notate the plans, tell me exactly what type of fixtures I need to go where. I will take the structural engineer's report, and I'll submit it to AllDraft and we'll get updated copies. Submit that to the county a month ago. And he was, like, \"Where do you need help with?\" I said, \"That's what I need you to do. Just go through, take the take the plans and mark out exactly where all the fixtures and everything that you want need to be so then I can change the plans till they reflect exactly how the work is going to be.\" So, everything you're telling him, I had already told him a month ago. And for whatever reason, he didn't do it. And so, that's why I kind of just, like, let him do whatever because he's going to do whatever, anyways. And that's, like, where it all, like, boils down to, essentially. Okay. Uh so there's your There's your second sides. Yeah. I know. I get it. This This is what you need to do. So Yeah. So, what I was going to do was I was going to send him an email, and I was going to send him an email, and I was going to say, you know, pretty much resetting all the expectations, telling him exactly what I need from him, which is I need him to uh send me the revised plans that we need to submit. Do this. Do this. Meet at the property Thursday if you have time. Go room to room, mark up the plans in real time, talk about whatever needs to get done, and then let him know you'll submit the plans to the company. Once they're done with it, you'll send them to the county. And then, once the county approves it, then he's got to go find his own people. Just GC it. You don't want more bad blood between y'all. Um and uh and then you guys can figure out the finances later. I think you need to let this one go. Which I mean, would be the easiest thing for me. But, it's You know. also, how does that happen? It's not as easy as what you're saying. Um No, I know. I know. I Like I said, there there's an outstanding amount of finances due, and I go, \"You'll have to do a delta analysis later, and you guys will both have to come up with a number that you guys agree upon.\" Uh but, right now, I go, for your sanity, I'm talking to him, right? This advice is for your sanity. Yeah. I go, \"Find your own people.\" I go, \"Ib's going through some health issues, and you don't want to get to the point where he gets some guys, and then he doesn't show up to babysit them. And they're, like, 'Well, hey, if the cat's away, the mice will play.'\" Cuz that's just what's going to happen with construction people. Um no one's GCing it. Things are going to get stalled again. It's going to be repeat 3.0 again. I go, \"Find your own people. Then you hold their feet to the flame. And that's it.\" Yeah, I mean But then, then he can do what? I mean, he can do what needs to be done himself. He doesn't need me to walk through the house. No, no. He needs you right now to get the plans updated. He needs some guidance in that space in terms of, you know, \"Look, the inspector said this or that. Or I need this and this.\" Um and then you'll know what that equates out into plan speak so you can get the plans updated once And then you're, you know, you're the liaison between the plans getting updated and him. So, once you submit all the stuff, then verify that all the things that you guys talked about are on the plans, and everything is good. Submit it to the village. And then I Maybe the village will come back with a question or two or, \"Hey, we need some clarification on this.\" You know, just handhold him through that process. But, once the village comes back and says, \"Okay, everything is good. You guys can start now,\" then cut him loose. You're out of the picture. The only time you need to get brought back in is when they do that final inspection because the permit's under your name. So, you you may want to be there, or he's got to be there with whoever the people are. And any changes and all that other stuff happens, it's on him. It has nothing to do with you. The problem is That's what I told him what he needs to do. The problem is uh I mean, he can just switch the He can switch the contractors. Um so, he can switch it to somebody else, but the permit can be can be completely switched. Um the Yeah. the uh the lender has Like, we'll make payments directly to me. So, if That that can easily be solved. Hey, you know what? This uh the the current construction company I had, he was using a bunch of illegal people, and, as it runs in the news, um Chicago got a big raid on them. Yeah. No, I mean, it doesn't even It, like, all that doesn't matter, either. Like, it's the it's the client's Or it's the owner's responsibility to find a qualified GC. So, he can just All he has to do is go back to his loan company and be, like, \"We're switching GCs.\" Like, \"This is the new GC.\" Um Because there's nothing that that is requires you to be in there once the permits Once Once the plans are approved. There's nothing that says Ibrahim's got to do this. Yeah, but even even for the plans, like, he's already reached out to the drafting company that I used. And there's a lady there that uh is, essentially, like, will deal with people that don't know what they're talking about, tell them, like, he can he'll deal with uh Well, here here here. I I Okay. I would suggest you handhold them through this until the plans are updated. You don't want to just cut bait and leave him out hanging like that. That would just look really bad based on all the things that have Look, there's plenty of fault on your side. There's plenty of fault on his side. I think a good transition point is get the plans updated, get him handhold it through the village. Do be available for any Q&As that the inspector has. But, once the inspector goes, \"Okay, I've got all my questions done. Um everything looks good. Go ahead, start work,\" then cut him loose. I think that is a good transition point between him bringing on his own people, him GCing himself, doing whatever he needs to do. Like, even even before all this was happening, and I I didn't know you were involved, I told them I'm, like, \"Look, dude, we got so many people here in our basketball group.\" I go And I told them I go, \"If you're not redoing your outside walls, I go, you buy everyone pizza. We come in here, pull all the outside drywall off, reinsulate everything, re-drywall it. No one will know what happened. And that's all free labor.\" Cuz anyone can hang drywall. We just need it hung. You Then you have the artisans come in and do the mudding, taping. Um so, I even I even had told him to do that when um when I go, \"Why aren't you doing the outside? Just gut everything.\" And um and then And then I got the whole scoop of what's going on and all this other jazz. I was like, \"Oh, okay, okay.\" So, I mean, let him let him GC it however he wants to do it. Find people on Facebook Marketplace. Whatever, it doesn't matter. You're out of it now. Um the plans are all approved. It's a clean transition. Okay, that's fine. I mean, I don't think we need to meet there, but um Well, look. I mean, look. Like I said, if if I was you, I would get a set of plans, go room by room, mark everything up, and and you'll know how to mark it up and what the what what um changes needs to get made. And you can, then, you know, relay that back to the drafting company. They'll take however long they take to make the updates. You'll get them back. Just make sure everything is in sync. Submit it to the village, be available for any questions. But, once the village gives the green light, you're out. And, at that point, that's a standard work. He can go take those plans, give it to whoever he wants to give it to, um and they just have to work off the plans. Yeah, I mean, it's going to cost him money. I think that I think that's the best way to uh for you guys to uh part ways. Cuz there's also a level of animosity built up. Um it's just It's it's it's going to be, like, tit for tat. It's it's Both y'all are not in a good place. He's second-guessing everything you're doing. Um it's just not not in a good place right now. So, this is my suggestion. Um And I told him if if If you guys don't do it, Okay. Yeah. Uh you'll be at the same point a year from now. No, so this is what I I will If he wants to do this, then we can we can do that. That's fine. The other thing that I was going to propose is we Again, we do what exactly what you're talking about. We finalize the plans, and we get county approval, and then we finalize all of the uh the financial changes, just like we had done uh before. And whatever the I mean, look. You're going to have to do the financial stuff regardless. Yeah, so that's what I'm saying. We We finalize the plans, submit them. And then we Yeah. you know, go back and forth. I already told him, like, \"This is how much more\" Uh I gave him a ballpark. Uh this is And I had stuff written down. I gave him a ballpark of how much more we would need. And so, he already knows what that number is. Um with that plus, maybe, a little bit more, like, I can I can finish the uh I can finish the project. Stop. Stop. Let it go. I mean, I would love to, but Let this Let this one go. Sort out the finances when While the plans are getting updated, sort the finances out with him. Mhm. Let this one go, dude. It's not worth it. But I'm telling you, you guys are going to be back at this point in July. Something's going to happen. God forbid you get sick again or you can't show up, but something else will happen, and it'll be July, and nothing's getting done. And then he'll call me up, and, \"Hey, Faraz, why it's been 3 months since any work's been done? What's going on?\" Yeah. And I'll be like, \"Why are you asking me, dude? Well, I told you what you needed to do. And both of you didn't listen.\" Get the plans updated while the plans are being reviewed. Sort out the finances. Once the village gives its green light, you're out. That's fine. I mean, that would be easier for me. Yeah. Now, now, I'm going to tell you this. If, for whatever reason, you guys kiss and make up and he decides to continue to use you, you got to uphold your end. I get it. You got health issues, but you got to you got to get the stuff done. The getting the work done is is not a problem. It's it's everything else, like I told you. The way that he's handling things, and it was And then And then And you got to be upfront about that stuff, too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, which is what I'm going to You you can't be, \"Hey, look, we we're friends. I get it.\" No. Look, there's friendship, and then there's professionalism. At this point, if you keep butting in, then you're on your own. But, you know it's going to happen cuz you've got a year of it. That's why I'm telling you to let it go. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's why I was going to lay it out and tell him that all project discussions have to be through email and all phone calls have to be scheduled. And that's it. And Or for your sanity and his, you can let it go. Yeah. I'm I'm going to keep saying it. I I think No, no. That's going to be That's going to be I'll tell him. That's going to be option one, and this is option two. And if any of these Yeah. things that I'm listing out, which is we need to finalize the plans, finalize the financial updated financial scope, updated payment terms, and updated communication protocols, don't get adhered to, then we go back to option one. And Okay. I You like the separate separate way? In my opinion, option one is the first three choices. Trust me when I tell you this. Option one is the first three choices. Yeah. No, I I The the problem that I see Handhold it handhold it through the the inspection part with the village or the plan review, and then that is a clean transition. You're not leaving anyone hanging. It's a clean transition. It's all new work that needs to get done based on the permits or on the on the new plans. Walk away. Okay. Uh then I'll I'll type this up, and I'll send it in an email to him, and I'll CC you on it. And we'll communicate that way. I I don't want to I think it's just all going to be in writing. Yeah. So, So, are you fine with me CCing you on it? Yeah, yeah. That's fine. That's fine. I'm in. Use me for arbitration. Which uh email? It's I only have one. It's my first name, my last name at Gmail. Yeah. No, I just want to make sure. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. That's fine, then. Uh I'll type it up, and I'll send it, and uh we'll go from there. Yeah. Yeah. Um but uh do it quick cuz today's Wednesday. Tomorrow's Thursday. Yeah. He said he was going to be there at 5:00 or 6:00 tomorrow. Um so I said, \"Okay, that's fine.\" I go, \"Don't\" \"I can't go too late because I got Jon on Thursday night.\" Um so uh as long as we get done by, like, 7:30 And even if you guys go over, that's fine. You guys can go over. I'm going to I'm going to bus bust out at, like, 7:30, 7:45. That'll give me enough time to get to Jon. Um yeah. Um that's that's fine. Uh I think it's the mainly is the details about everything else after that because what's going to happen is he's going to have the permits, and then he's going to start calling people. And uh, you know, the electrician is going to charge him x amount, and he's going to have to pay the remaining balance for the plumber. Um you know, then he's going to have to find drywallers, this, that, tilers, and, I mean, this guy cannot number one, cannot handle all this stuff by himself. And, even if he manages to be able to get that far, uh the cost that it's going to cost him a lot more than if I were to just finish it. Ibrahim? Yeah. No, no. I'll let it go, but how do we figure out No. that delta? That's something That That's, look, at that point, you you're going to have to sit down, and, \"Well, this how much time I've invested? This is the what It's cost me already. Um this is the number.\" And And, look. And and bottom line is if you can pay it now, great. But, you were very clear that day. You go, \"I have no money.\" So, you have to figure out some kind of payment schedule. And, as long as you guys figure out the payment schedule, \"Look, I'll give you,\" you know, \"$200 a month for the rest of my life.\" Whatever it comes out to, I don't know. I was making something up. Then that's it. But if I'm telling you, if if Look, I I'm quite older than you guys. I've seen these things unravel. I I I I'm playing chess in my head. I can see this thing blowing up into a really bad lawsuit a few months from now. I mean, I don't think so because, well, no, number one, I don't care about any getting any more money. I just want to That's the reason you keep bringing up that you just want to finish is because you don't have the ability to go back in and and pay back the money that's been given already. Well, obviously, that's 100%, but then, also, I want to document that what I've actually spent were my actual costs, and so that I'm already operating, if you include, you know, actual hard costs that have been spent plus overhead, that there's been no money that's actually been made because of everything all this scope creep, all the increase stuff. That's my concern. All right. Then I would suggest this because uh of the inability to pay back the money that's already been paid out, um I would suggest this. And this kind of puts your feet to the flame. There has to be consequences if things get delayed, meaning that, \"Okay, everything is done, and, based on all the work,\" let's just say it takes a month and a half to get everything completed. If things aren't getting done in a month and a half, then it's on you. And it's money that you've got to pay back to him because you're not meeting your schedule. So, there's got to be some metrics that get set up in his favor so things get done. Again, that is also fine, but if he's saying he doesn't have the money to pay for whatever the difference was, he didn't have the budget for the original money that I had quoted him, and the money that's remaining has to be paid from the lender, and the lender requires the work to be done first before they disperse funds, then how am I going to be able to move forward? Uh look. At that point, well, let's just Let's get to that point. Um let's first do this base things, right? Get Get the two things done. Get the plans updated, sent to the village. While they're reviewing it, work out the financials to figure out what the delta is right now. So, Ib bring in a list of, \"Here's all the things that have happened so far. Here's what everything has cost so far.\" Um and then I mean, look. Like I said, there's money left over. You can show, \"This is the money that's left over now.\" Um and then, from that point on, you can You guys can figure out Option A, B, and C is for him to GC it himself, send it to other people. Option four would be, all right, if you want me to come back in Even even if he has to go and do it himself, he's going to get the finances somehow. He can go back to the lender and just be like, \"Yo, you know what? The the guy's entire crew was illegal. They got busted up. He's gone. Um I've I hired a new company. I need funds.\" Yeah. They're going to have to go in and do their whole reappraisal based on, you know, it's been a year and a half. There's There's more equity built into it. Values has gone up, blah, blah, blah, right? So, um they'll they'll have to figure it out. And, look, they're a lender. They've seen it all. They've been there, done that. This isn't the first rodeo for them, either. Yeah, again, I already had told him all this. So, what you're saying, I already told him. The problem is, even when it came down to submitting the changes, he is stuck on the money part of it for every single thing cuz he's like, \"We had three revisions included in the price. If we go over that, then I'm going to get charged more.\" And then that's probably why he never actually submitted the changes, even though I told him this is what we need to get done a month ago. And then, so, there's no way he's going to go back to the lender and be, like, \"I need more money\" because, again, in his head, he's always pinching the pennies. He he He's He's going to have to because the conversation I just had with you is what I told them when I went to meet with him yesterday. I told them, \"Work with you, get the plans updated, and then, once the village says okay, then go find your own people.\" I go, \"You guys are going to have to figure out the delta uh of what's owed to you, but I told him.\" I go, \"The delta that's owed to you isn't going to be enough to take care of all the work that's left to be done.\" And he knows that. He's going to have to go get finances on his own, whether it's borrowing from his in-laws or going back to the bank or whatever it is. He knows he's going to have to go get money to get the job done. Yeah. And I I that's the whole thing is if he already knows that, then I'm willing to, like I said, finish the project. These are the terms, and this is what needs to be changed. Or I walk away. Or, yeah. Like you said. Yeah. Or walk away. Walk away. Figure out how much you're owed, and walk away. Well, no. That's what I'm saying. I wouldn't owe him anything because I have all these documented costs. And I haven't made any money because of all the cost overruns and everything else. So, there's no money to be made. Yeah. There's no money to be paid back. Well, I wouldn't say that. I I don't think $100,000 worth of work's been done, dude. Yeah. I don't think it's that much. No, but Yeah. So So, look. Yeah. If If he gave you $100,000, even if I take in the plans of of the uh the the the blueprints getting done, let's just say that was $20,000. $100,000 worth of work has not been done in that place. Yeah, so $100,000 worth of time and worth of material and labor, no. But, $100,000 worth of material and labor and then time for for administrative costs for getting all of the plans and permits and everything else to whether to where it is plus the cost of my overhead and the cost of my profit is what you're not considering. Yeah, Ibrahim don't do that. That's the perfect recipe for lawsuit, and he'll get you. I mean, he hired a business. So, what am I expected to do? Yeah, but, I mean, come on, bro. There isn't $100,000 worth of work done. Again, there just isn't. Which is why I'm saying it's going to cost him more to hire other people. And I told him this, also, \"I will finish the work. We need to figure out all these differences.\" Ibrahim walk away. I'm telling you, walk away. Figure out how much my Look, you owe him money. Figure out what that delta is. It's not going to be $50,000. It might be $30,000 based on everything else. Come to a number, agree on it, figure out a payment schedule, walk away. Again, I don't see how Or or or if you don't want to pay that back, you're going to need more money to get it done, but you got to have ramifications in that. \"If you don't meet your time schedule, then you're getting fined.\" And it's got to be something ludicrous, like every week you miss, it's $10,000 off the price. Yeah, but You got You got to have some valid skin in the game to make it worth his while to come back to you again based on a year of this going on. Again, if we take the original I can I can Has he Has he showed you what the original scope of work was that we No, and I don't care, dude. I I don't care what the original scope of work was. I I I had conversations with both you guys. I went, walked the property. I've seen what's going on. Look, there's a lot of bad blood that's going on between both y'all. And, like I said, there's plenty of blame on both sides uh to go through. In my opinion, when things like this happen, it's not salvageable. Find a good transition point, and then cut loose. Now, if you want to go back in and re-bid it, then go ahead and re-bid it. But, for him to pick you, there's going to have to be consequences for not meeting deliverable timelines. And it's just very And, look, even if it's, \"Hey, man, my workers didn't show up,\" too bad. We agreed on this. This is the terms and conditions. The place would have been done by April 1st, and it's not. So, it's $10,000 every week that it's not getting done. So now Now there's onus on you to make sure that it's not a repeat of 2024. How does If you feel confident about it, then um then, you know, by all means, go. But, I'm going to tell him, \"If he picks you, you's He's got to hold your feet to the flame.\" Yeah. I mean, and as long as he stays Well, no. At that point, you you guys have to have, \"Hey, look. This is what I'm That's what you're hiring me to do. I'm not going to go,\" you know, \"use your shit. It's my stuff, and that's it.\" And if you want to get involved and you want to do stuff, then, you know what? Just go do it and cut me loose. And then we'll figure out what I owe you, and, you know what? It might not be If you think that you know, \"I owe you $50,000.\" I'll I I don't. And I'll do all the paperwork to show you that I really only owe you $15,000 or $20,000. Mhm. I mean, we can Yeah. I mean, that's fine. Yeah. So, So so Shoot him a message. Tell him you'll meet him tomorrow. I can't remember if it said 5:00 or 6:00. Um but uh I'll I'll I'll come out there at 6:00 um just because I'm going to be in Indiana um for one of the stores' grand openings. So, um I'll I'll come there after. I figure, by the time I mean, I'm going to leave the tail end of traffic, so I should get there by, like, 6:00. And then, okay, um uh So, you you know I told you I retired, right? Yeah. Yeah, so I retired. There there's two healthcare things that I'm working on right now. Um and then one of my friends, old-school friend of mine, um he has a brokerage of real estate firms in Florida. And he's doing a lot of flips. And he's got a blanket of wealthy, wealthy, stupid-rich investors. But, he doesn't know the first thing when it comes to construction. So, he pinged me up last year, and he goes, \"Hey, if you come to Florida, open up a construction company, I can send you five to 10 jobs a month easy based on these flips that my brokerage firm gets.\" So, I told him, I'm like, \"Look,\" I go, \"I don't want to do anything until after Ramadan next year.\" So, he's been on my case nonstop. \"Hey, you know what? These other jobs came through. These other jobs came through.\" Um so I'm letting you know if you want to um open up a uh uh go work in Florida.\" And I don't know how realistic it is, but, you know, you have young kids and this and that. But, I mean, look, all my kids are grown up now, so I can I can travel. I don't have to be home. They're all in college. Um so I was going to after Ramadan, open up a construction firm in Florida and uh and, you know, hire a bunch of guys and and work on these flips. So, just I'm just letting you know, if you ever want to, you know, get in on that, let me know. No, probably not. Um but, yeah, I mean, I have I have other uh other stuff. But, I mean, I don't know. I'm maybe. I got to finish up and clean up all the stuff first. But uh fine. I mean, I will draft up a an email. I'll send you the draft, and then I'll send it to him, and we'll go from there. Yep, okay. All right. All right, dude. I'll see you tomorrow, then. Okay. Yeah. All right. All right. Sounds good. Yeah.

The Root Cause of the Issues**\n- **Mirza Baig pulled a 203(k) loan**, which **forced** you to pull permits and deal with county regulations.  \n- The house had **layers of DIY, non-permitted work**, causing **structural, plumbing, and electrical compliance issues.**  \n- The **county inspections were stricter than expected**, requiring **revised plans, structural engineer approval, and extensive rework.**  \n- The project **ballooned in complexity, cost, and timeline**—something that could have been avoided had he simply **bought, lightly renovated, and moved in.**  \n\n### **2. Client’s Lack of Understanding of Construction & Permitting**\n- **He does not understand the process**—he expected work to be finished while **ignoring the delays caused by permits and inspections.**  \n- **He constantly micromanages**—bringing in his own contractors, **buying materials from Facebook Marketplace**, and making decisions that don’t align with the scope.  \n- He **pinches pennies but wastes dollars**—complains about costs yet **keeps requesting changes** (e.g., new windows, heated floors).  \n- He **doesn’t follow instructions**—you told him a month ago to mark up the plans; **he never did it.**  \n- He is **highly reactive**—constantly calling, involving other people, escalating problems instead of **working methodically.**  \n\n### **3. Your Financial & Logistical Challenges**\n- **You lowered your price from $160K to $120K**—leaving **no contingency for unforeseen costs.**  \n- **You fronted costs for plans, permits, and administrative work**, which added up to **$7,500+** in drafting fees alone.  \n- The lender **only releases funds after work is completed**, forcing you to **finance parts of the project out-of-pocket.**  \n- **Additional work was required due to permit compliance**, including:\n  - A **floor drain & ejector pit** (required by the county).\n  - **Replumbing the hall bathroom & kitchen** (not included in the original scope).\n  - **Sistering joists due to plumbing inspector’s notes**.  \n- You **were already financially strained**, leading to **delays in your responsiveness.**  \n- You are **mentally and emotionally drained**, exacerbated by **constant calls, texts, and interference from the client.**  \n\n### **4. The Emotional & Mental Toll It’s Taken on You**\n- You **stopped responding** because you were **burnt out** and **overwhelmed**.  \n- Mirza Baig **kept calling incessantly**, despite knowing your situation.  \n- He **crossed professional boundaries** by contacting **your wife and former business partner.**  \n- **You don’t even want to pick up his calls anymore** because you know he’ll be **arguing, micromanaging, or escalating the situation.**  \n\n### **5. Your Uncle’s Suggestion vs. Your Reality**\n- **Your Uncle’s Recommendation:**  \n  - Help Mirza **finalize the plans, submit them to the county, and walk away**.  \n  - Let him **find his own contractors and manage the project himself**.  \n  - Settle finances later in a **separate conversation**.  \n  - Avoid getting dragged into **more disputes and project delays.**  \n- **Your Counterpoints:**\n  - You **don’t want to walk away** without recovering **at least some of your costs**.  \n  - You **want to finish the project**, but only under **strict new conditions** (updated plans, financial agreement, scheduled communication).  \n  - **Walking away isn’t that simple**—you’ve already spent too much time and money.  \n\n### **6.

Given the challenges we’ve faced, I need to establish a structured path forward that works for both of us.  \n\n### **Path Forward (Two Options)**  \n**Option 1: Transition to a New General Contractor**  \n- I will **finalize the plans and submit them to ALDRAFT** for updates.  \n- Once ALDRAFT completes the revisions, I will **submit them to the county for approval.**  \n- Once the county **approves the revised plans**, you will **take over management of the project**.  \n- You will be responsible for **hiring a new contractor** or **managing individual trades.**  \n- We will **settle outstanding finances separately**.  \n\n**Option 2: Continue with Windy City Construction (Under Strict Conditions)**  \n- We finalize **updated financial terms, including additional costs incurred due to permitting requirements, delays, and scope changes.**  \n- A **new payment structure** must be agreed upon before work resumes.  \n- All **communication will be via email, and all phone calls must be scheduled in advance**.  \n- Any **additional changes must be documented through formal change orders.**  \n- If these conditions are **not met**, we will proceed with **Option 1 (you taking over the project).**  \n\nPlease confirm which option you would like to proceed with. If you choose **Option 2**, we will schedule a final financial review and sign an updated agreement before continuing.  \n\nBest,  \nIbrahim  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Prepare a Financial Breakdown Document**\n- **List all costs incurred to date.**  \n- **Separate what was included in the original contract vs. additional work.**  \n- **Clearly state how much is still due.**  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Enforce Boundaries & Stop Any Further Work Until Issues Are Settled**\n- **No more answering random calls or texts.**  \n- **Do not show up to the house until a written agreement is in place.**  \n- **If he refuses to agree on finances, proceed with Option 1 and walk away.**  \n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n- If you **stay in this project**, it must be **strictly on your terms**—no more micromanaging, no unpaid work, no personal interference.  \n- If you **walk away**, ensure that you at least **finalize plans and submit them** so you **leave cleanly and without potential legal issues.**  \n- You **should never have taken on this project at such a low bid**—this is a valuable lesson for the future.  \n- You **need to prioritize your mental health**—this client has been **draining you financially, emotionally, and mentally.**  \n\n---\n\n# **Decision Time**\nDo you want to:\n1. **Send the email and enforce the two-option plan?**  \n2. **Finalize plans, submit them, and walk away?**  \n3. **Try to finish the job but only under new financial & communication agreements?**  \n\nWhichever route you take, you **must take control and stop letting Mirza Baig dictate the project.** Let me know if you need me to draft anything else."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"ffc706fe-0343-4196-babf-489368477c3a","request_id":"914a1c059bf5eb6a-SJC","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ffc706fe-0343-4196-babf-489368477c3a","children":["dd7953d3-3092-4e6a-876f-1ef928af46f6","89ef76a3-7810-4b35-912c-18290d7c03ff"]},"dd7953d3-3092-4e6a-876f-1ef928af46f6":{"id":"dd7953d3-3092-4e6a-876f-1ef928af46f6","message":{"id":"dd7953d3-3092-4e6a-876f-1ef928af46f6","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740009551.135314,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["2.

Here’s why it matters:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Protects You from Future Liability**\n- **Right Now:** The project is in a **gray area** where work has started, but permits are incomplete, and inspections have flagged compliance issues.  \n- **If You Walk Away Without Finalized Plans:** The county could later find **permit violations, structural deficiencies, or non-compliant work**—and since **you were the listed contractor**, they could try to **hold you responsible.**  \n- **By Finalizing the Plans & Getting County Approval:**  \n  - It **clearly defines** the approved scope of work.  \n  - The **county officially signs off** on what needs to be done.  \n  - You **are no longer the one responsible** for figuring out what is needed.  \n  - If another contractor takes over, they **must follow the approved plans**, and the responsibility shifts to them.  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Ensures a Clean Permit Transition**\n- **Right Now:** You **pulled the permits under your company’s name**.  \n- **Risk If You Walk Away Without Closing the Loop:**  \n  - The project is left in **permit limbo**, where the **county still considers you responsible.**  \n  - If another contractor comes in and **does not follow protocol**, you could still be **named in any permit violations.**  \n  - If the county conducts an inspection before a new contractor is assigned, they might demand **corrective work**, which could still be tied to **your name** as the original permit holder.  \n- **By Finalizing the Plans & Getting Approval:**  \n  - The revised plans **become an official, approved document**.  \n  - You **can submit a permit transfer request** so the new contractor takes over the permit officially.  \n  - If Mirza Baig brings in another GC, they are working **from a defined scope**, and **your name is no longer tied to future work.**  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Prevents Disputes Over “Unfinished Work”**\n- **Right Now:** Mirza Baig could argue that you “left the job unfinished” or that “$100,000 worth of work isn’t visible.”  \n- **If You Leave Without Finalized Plans:**  \n  - He can claim **you abandoned the job** in an unapproved, incomplete state.  \n  - He can **blame you for delays, extra costs, or non-compliant work.**  \n  - If he tries to **file a lawsuit** for incomplete work, he might argue that **you failed to complete what was required.**  \n- **By Finalizing the Plans:**  \n  - You clearly document **what was required and what still needs to be done.**  \n  - He can **no longer claim that you were responsible for delays or additional work** since the county would have already defined the next steps.  \n  - If a legal dispute arises, you can say:  \n    - “I finalized and submitted all required documents.”  \n    - “I provided the approved scope for completion.”  \n    - “He decided to continue the project on his own.”  \n\n---\n\n## **4. Ensures a Financially Fair Exit**\n- **Right Now:** He might argue that **you owe him work** because “$100,000 was already paid.”  \n- **If You Leave Without Finalizing Plans:**  \n  - He might claim you “walked away” without completing what he paid for.  \n  - He could demand a **refund or legal compensation** for “unfinished work.”  \n  - The lender might also question the **status of the project**, making it harder for you to **argue for any remaining payments.**  \n- **By Finalizing the Plans:**  \n  - You can show that **the project reached a defined point,** and the remaining work was based on county-mandated updates.  \n  - Any additional work required was **not your responsibility,** but the county’s compliance requirements.  \n  - If he **wants a refund or disputes your costs**, you can point to **time spent on permitting, planning, and compliance** that ate into the budget.  \n\n---\n\n## **5. Avoids Future Legal Complaints from the County**\n- **Right Now:** The county has **not approved** the full scope of work.  \n- **If You Walk Away Without Approved Plans:**  \n  - The county might demand **modifications** that Mirza Baig or his new contractor **fail to follow.**  \n  - If they **cut corners or do unpermitted work**, the **county could still associate violations with your name** (since you originally pulled the permits).  \n  - This could lead to **stop-work orders, fines, or liability issues.**  \n- **By Finalizing the Plans & Getting Approval:**  \n  - The county **takes over responsibility for ensuring compliance**.  \n  - If Mirza or his new GC fails to follow the plans, **that’s their problem—not yours.**  \n  - You **legally separate yourself** from the project’s completion.  \n\n---\n\n### **Bottom Line:**\nBy finalizing the plans and submitting them to the county:  \n✔ **You create a clear, documented cutoff point for your involvement.**  \n✔ **You ensure county approval for the remaining work, reducing liability.**  \n✔ **You prevent disputes over what you were “supposed to finish.”**  \n✔ **You set the stage for a clean transition to another contractor.**  \n\nThis is the best way to **legally and professionally walk away without risk**. If he refuses to finalize the plans, then you have documented proof that **he was the bottleneck, not you.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"9213cdda-707d-468b-9eb2-75fb26f93052","request_id":"914a358a9be1356a-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9213cdda-707d-468b-9eb2-75fb26f93052","children":["649733f6-23bb-4eba-9161-d6ac57df1989"]},"649733f6-23bb-4eba-9161-d6ac57df1989":{"id":"649733f6-23bb-4eba-9161-d6ac57df1989","message":{"id":"649733f6-23bb-4eba-9161-d6ac57df1989","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740016267.383794,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How do we reach an agreement financially?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"914ad983eb8649f4-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"17be76cc-f6db-408d-be6f-ec6fede64fc5","children":["e614fbd9-8d58-4ecc-a656-c5d6f4612639"]},"e614fbd9-8d58-4ecc-a656-c5d6f4612639":{"id":"e614fbd9-8d58-4ecc-a656-c5d6f4612639","message":{"id":"e614fbd9-8d58-4ecc-a656-c5d6f4612639","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740016322.220327,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### **How to Reach a Financial Agreement with Mirza Baig**\nTo **exit cleanly** while **recovering as much money as possible**, you need to:\n1. **Document what has been paid vs. what was actually done**  \n2. **Determine what is still owed** (if anything)  \n3. **Separate out any disputed amounts**  \n4. **Propose a financial settlement structure**  \n5. **Negotiate a resolution**  \n\nHere’s the **step-by-step breakdown** of how to reach a financial agreement.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Create a Financial Breakdown (Organized & Documented)**\nYou need **a clear, itemized list** of what has been paid and what has actually been done.  \n\n### **A.

You were looking for an out before. He somehow roped you back in.\nA: That's what this article is saying. At the end of the day... What'd he say about him finding out the numbers? Huh? What'd he say about finding out the numbers and calling?\nA: he called him here too. I mean he says it's not a line. He's like trying to play both sides. He's put himself in the middle. It's not like he was caught in the middle.\nA: What needs to happen then is... he doesn't need me for... any of it.\nB: And that the problem like really came here. I talked to him. I told him what was going on. And he\nA: said, OK, like what do you need help with? Like what can I do? I told him. You heard me say that, right? But did he? Take notes.\nA: If you told him everything that needs to be done, and then you just left it a verbal agreement.\nB: Mirza is actually... the reason why he's like this is because he's just... cheap person. He has a cheap mindset. And he's anxious. Like he just... that's the type of person who he is. So... like...\nA: The reason why he didn't submit, he had all of that stuff.\nB: that was needed to get submitted to all draft, and he didn't submit it because we have three revisions included in the price, and he's afraid that if we submit this, that's our last revision, and if we need any more, then he has to pay for it.\nD: So that's why he didn't submit it, because...\nA: We will charge him more for him. any more revisions specifically, but you have other change orders that are... No, but that's the whole problem is that...\nB: Like. He's like. Like trying to pick up pennies and like every time he bends over like he's having like dollar bills falling out of his pocket.\nB: That's the type of person that he is. That's like a character assumption that's not affecting what you need to do now. You want to get out, and you have your out right now.\nD: Yeah, but I need to make sure that it is documented that all of this stuff\nD: But you can e-mail him instead of like, instead of saying like, This is what I need from you going forward to follow these rules of engagement, you can say, We had this discussion before, you didn't do this, instead you did this, whatever. Lay it all out.\nA: do that final walk through or whatever. What's the point of doing a final walk through?\nB: ghosting him like you have been? Like you're setting a boundary that because he did all these things. I\nD: haven't been answering because he will call once and then just keep calling. And that's what pissed me off. So that's why I didn't answer. Not because I intentionally didn't want to talk to him.\nD: is, that's why you don't want to answer, because you don't want to be confrontation, like, you don't want the confrontation. And then he also...\nB: No, it's this whole thing that I didn't answer because he's going to be like, Okay, what do we need to do next? And I already told him what needed to happen. He didn't do it. He started doing his own thing. And so, like, that's the whole thing. So, that's what needs to be like documented. You can document like all of the reasons why you don't want to continue working with\nD: not about character assumptions. Like, what did you tell him to do that wasn't done? What lines did he cross professionally? Just lay that all out. It's not like telling him, like, You're being too cheap. Like, you don't need to talk about any of that stuff. You don't\nB: That's what he does, like, to anybody. You guys, you told me that, like, for something else. Huh?\nB: Something with the county like. I was like I called the county. I was like I told him I called this guy at the county. I left a message. I never heard back. I called him the next day, left a message, never heard back. And he was like, what do you want me to do it? Like I'll like blow up his phone until like he responds. And. I didn't like remember the time and not remember.\nA: not worth fending things off properly. You should sever it as cleanly as possible.\nD: Like, for like two months now you've been telling me, like, you just don't want to do it. Like, it just overwhelms you, the thought of it overwhelms you. But I\nB: didn't realize why I didn't want to do it. And so... Because you don't want to keep doing the follow-up. Like, it requires so much executive function going back and forth.\nA: you could come down at once, but then you have to just be on top of it and keep going back to it, which is what you struggle with. That's why.\nA: No, but that... That wasn't it. I think I'm trying to say that's it.\nB: I think that's what made it hard, but... But you would have done it for somebody who didn't annoy you. No, I would have done it if I can... Like I said, it was my fault for giving him a little bit of\nB: leeway and he just took it too far.\nD: Do you mean getting back into it after that talk? No, even from the beginning. Leeway how? Huh? Leeway how? Like, my quote involved material and it had... it had prices listed out.\nA: For, let's say, tile, whatever. $79 a square foot.\nB: a profit margin, there's a markup, and there's all of that that's built in, and then so if he goes and picks a more expensive tile, I initially I told him, which is where I made a mistake, like I wouldn't have done this with anybody else, but I was trying to be nice, and I told him like, Fine, you can go pick whatever you want, and we'll just like figure out\nB: And then we'll just add it back in. And... But if there's anybody else, I would have just been like... You have the choices. This is what you have to choose.\nB: No, like this is what we had budgeted, and go to Floor and Decor, or wherever, pick something that's this price.\nD: I don't think that's a good .\nB: No, that's price or less. Whatever you choose, if you want something else that's more expensive, then you can choose whatever you want and that gets added in. Yeah, then they'll expect like, okay, I chose a lesser expensive child, so I should get a break on the price.\nB: And that's the problem. But he didn't choose a less expensive tile. He just wanted to buy tile off of Facebook Marketplace. And the problem is now if that tile is not something that's readily available. If we don't have enough or something happens, then we can't just go and get more.\nB: happens later because we installed that tile. It's not my responsibility because I didn't provide the tile. And so that's where all the stuff breaks down just because I let him do whatever he wanted to do. Same thing with like the vanity like he went.\nA: not a reputable business, like just... Like just one of the guys that has a bunch of workers, like... You know what I mean?\nD: The problem is he can't because he got a 203k loan, which is a mortgage with all the renovation costs built in. But\nB: he wants both is what I'm saying. He needs somebody who has a license but also wants to be able to manipulate the prices on his own.

Here’s a breakdown of the main points and how they fit into your decision-making process:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Mirza Baig’s Behavior Patterns Are the Root of the Issue**\n- **He is cheap and overly anxious**, which causes him to **second-guess everything and micromanage.**  \n- **He prioritizes saving pennies but loses dollars**—for example, buying **Facebook Marketplace tile** instead of using your planned material costs.  \n- **He refused to submit revisions to ALDRAFT** because he didn’t want to pay for extra revisions beyond the three included.  \n- **He changes things constantly**, disregarding your advice, and then **expects you to deal with the consequences.**  \n- **He wants full control over pricing and materials**, but at the same time, he **needs a licensed contractor to handle the permits and compliance**—which **contradicts itself.**  \n- **He did not need to get a 203(k) loan**—you advised him to take a better approach, but **he ignored your advice and complicated the process.**  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Your Own Missteps (That You Recognize Now)**\n- **You gave him too much leeway** because of your prior acquaintance, **which you wouldn’t have done for a typical client.**  \n- **You allowed him to dictate materials and scope changes** instead of sticking to your **original quote with material allowances.**  \n- **You did not enforce strict boundaries from the start**, which let the situation spiral.  \n- **You let the project stretch out because of your own struggles**, but even when you provided clear instructions, **he did not follow through.**  \n- **You have been ghosting him because you know he’s going to ask ‘What’s next?’ when you already told him and he didn’t do it.**  \n- **You struggle with the executive function required to constantly manage and follow up on the back-and-forth of this project.**  \n\n---\n\n## **3. The Psychological Toll on You**\n- **You have wanted out for months, but he keeps pulling you back in.**  \n- **The thought of dealing with this project is overwhelming**, especially given all your **other responsibilities and personal stressors.**  \n- **You are avoiding confrontation** because you know it will be an exhausting battle.  \n- **Your wife sees how much this project is affecting you** and is **encouraging you to take the exit now.**  \n\n---\n\n# **Final Recommended Action Plan**\nGiven all of the above, your **best move is to finalize the transition and exit the project as cleanly as possible.** Here’s what you should do:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Send the Final Email to Mirza Baig**\nYour email should:\n- **Lay out all the facts**—what was agreed upon, what wasn’t done, and what steps remain.  \n- **Make it clear that you are stepping away.**  \n- **Provide him a structured exit plan** (finalizing plans, submitting them, and letting him take over).  \n\n---\n\n### **Draft Email (Adjust as Needed)**\n**Subject:** Final Steps for 28W500 Kenwood Avenue  \n\nHi Mirza,  \n\nI am writing to formally clarify the next steps regarding your project. Given the challenges we have encountered and the changes in scope, I need to ensure a structured and documented path forward.  \n\n### **Final Steps to Transition the Project**  \n\n1. **Plan Revisions & Permit Updates**  \n   - I will **submit the final marked-up plans to ALDRAFT** for revision.  \n   - Once completed, the **updated plans will be submitted to the county for approval.**  \n   - Once the county approves, I will provide you with the final permit-ready documents.  \n\n2. **Handover of Project Management**  \n   - **You will be responsible for hiring a new GC or managing individual trades yourself.**  \n   - Once the plans are approved, you can proceed with securing contractors for framing, electrical, plumbing, etc.  \n   - I will ensure that the transition is documented properly so that you can continue smoothly.  \n\n3. **Financial Reconciliation**  \n   - A **detailed breakdown of all costs incurred** will be provided for transparency.  \n   - Any remaining financial matters will be addressed separately in a structured discussion.  \n\n### **Important Notes:**  \n- All **communication regarding the project must be via email.** I will not be available for unscheduled calls.  \n- My involvement **ends once the plans are approved and handed over to you.**  \n- If you wish to move forward under different terms, we must discuss that formally.  \n\nPlease confirm your acknowledgment of these steps so we can finalize this transition in a professional and structured manner.  \n\nBest,  \nIbrahim  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Prepare a Detailed Financial Summary**\n- Document **everything spent so far** (materials, permits, plans, labor).  \n- **Show your actual costs vs. what he has paid.**  \n- **Prove that you are not profiting and that overruns were due to county requirements and scope changes.**  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Enforce Boundaries Immediately**\n- **No more phone calls. Everything must be through email.**  \n- **Do not meet him in person unless absolutely necessary.**  \n- **If he starts blowing up your phone again, do not engage.**  \n\n---\n\n## **4. If He Pushes Back, Offer a Strict Alternative (But Only Once)**\nIf he refuses to take over the project and insists that you finish, **set strict conditions:**\n- **Updated financial agreement covering all additional costs.**  \n- **Full payment schedule with milestones.**  \n- **A written contract with clear scope and penalties for delays.**  \n\nIf he does not agree to this, **walk away completely.**\n\n---\n\n# **Final Thought: Let It Go**\nYour wife is right—you have wanted out for **months.**  \nYour uncle is right—you **have your out now.**  \n\nThis project has:\n- **Drained your finances.**  \n- **Taken an emotional toll on you.**  \n- **Stalled other important work you could be doing.**  \n\nYou have **nothing to gain** by staying in this situation any longer.  \nYour best course of action is to **document everything, submit the plans, and exit the project.**  \n\n### **Let me know if you need help drafting any documents, financial breakdowns, or additional communication templates.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"89ef76a3-7810-4b35-912c-18290d7c03ff","request_id":"914cd0578f296336-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"89ef76a3-7810-4b35-912c-18290d7c03ff","children":["10177021-69c9-42a4-b3a0-04e9052b5b91"]},"10177021-69c9-42a4-b3a0-04e9052b5b91":{"id":"10177021-69c9-42a4-b3a0-04e9052b5b91","message":{"id":"10177021-69c9-42a4-b3a0-04e9052b5b91","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740037212.714497,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The draft email that you wrote is a good start but it doesn't do what you suggested it needed to do"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"targeted_reply":"Your email should:\n\n*   **Lay out all the facts**—what was agreed upon, what wasn’t done, and what steps remain.\n*   **Make it clear that you are stepping away.**\n*   **Provide him a structured exit plan** (finalizing plans, submitting them, and letting him take over).","request_id":"914cd8e12b766336-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0722e7b1-622b-4628-8796-ef2e95532eb7","children":["ea2ef269-a44c-43a5-ae66-9ec6313493f8"]},"ea2ef269-a44c-43a5-ae66-9ec6313493f8":{"id":"ea2ef269-a44c-43a5-ae66-9ec6313493f8","message":{"id":"ea2ef269-a44c-43a5-ae66-9ec6313493f8","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740037212.715377,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"914cd8e12b766336-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"10177021-69c9-42a4-b3a0-04e9052b5b91","children":["0ca3bf4b-453d-46c8-8ac3-caa1054af3fb"]},"0ca3bf4b-453d-46c8-8ac3-caa1054af3fb":{"id":"0ca3bf4b-453d-46c8-8ac3-caa1054af3fb","message":{"id":"0ca3bf4b-453d-46c8-8ac3-caa1054af3fb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740037259.011083,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here’s a **more detailed version** of the email that fully lays out the facts, makes it **clear that you are stepping away**, and provides a **structured exit plan** while documenting everything necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Subject:** Transition & Final Steps for 28W500 Kenwood Avenue  \n\nHi Mirza,  \n\nI want to formally document the status of the 28W500 Kenwood Avenue project, clarify the outstanding issues, and outline the steps required to transition the project moving forward. This email serves as a final notice of my involvement and ensures that everything is clearly stated in writing.  \n\n## **1. Agreed Scope vs. Deviations from the Original Plan**  \nWhen we originally agreed on this project, the plan was:  \n- **Light renovations to move in quickly.**  \n- Work completed **without major structural, electrical, or plumbing changes** to avoid excessive costs.  \n- **Budget: $120,000** (after my initial quote of $160,000 was lowered).  \n\nHowever, due to **changes outside of my control**, the scope became significantly larger:  \n- The **203(k) loan required permits**, which triggered **strict compliance with DuPage County codes.**  \n- The **permit approval process required architectural plans**, structural revisions, and multiple inspections.  \n- **The lender’s schedule of values did not reflect reality,** leading to mismatches in funding releases.  \n- Additional **plumbing, structural repairs, and electrical changes** were necessary due to inspector requirements.  \n- You introduced **multiple changes mid-project**, including additional windows, reconfigured bathrooms, and material substitutions.  \n- The **materials purchasing process was altered**, leading to inconsistencies in the contract pricing.  \n- **Delays due to plan revisions and permit approvals** added extra administrative and labor costs that were not originally accounted for.  \n\nThese factors resulted in **significant cost overruns and delays**, and despite my best efforts to adjust, the situation became untenable.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Why I Am Stepping Away**  \nGiven the deviations from the original agreement and the increasing demands outside of my agreed scope, **I can no longer continue as the general contractor on this project.**  \n\nThe reasons for my decision include:  \n- **Financial Imbalance**: The cost overruns and scope changes have resulted in me operating at a loss, and there is no clear resolution on payments.  \n- **Lack of Adherence to Agreed Process**: Despite multiple discussions, tasks that were required on your end were not completed in a timely manner (e.g., plan markups, finalizing material selections).  \n- **Unrealistic Communication & Project Management Expectations**: The volume of calls, last-minute changes, and involvement of third parties without coordination has made it impossible to manage effectively.  \n- **Scope & Compliance Issues**: The work required to bring the project to code exceeds what I can reasonably take on within the constraints of our agreement.  \n\nFor these reasons, **I am formally stepping away from the project after completing the final transition steps outlined below.**  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Transition Plan (Final Steps Before Full Handover)**  \n\nTo ensure that you are able to move forward with another contractor smoothly, I will complete the following steps:  \n\n### **Final Steps I Will Complete Before Handover:**  \n✅ **Submit all necessary plan markups to ALDRAFT for final revisions.**  \n✅ **Once ALDRAFT finalizes the updated plans, submit them to DuPage County for approval.**  \n✅ **Ensure that the approved plans are handed over to you** for use by a new general contractor.  \n\n**Once these steps are completed, my involvement will be fully terminated.**  \n\n---\n\n## **4. Your Next Responsibilities (Post-Handover)**  \n\nOnce I submit the approved plans to you, you will be responsible for:  \n- **Hiring a new general contractor or managing trades directly.**  \n- **Coordinating with DuPage County for any additional permit-related inspections.**  \n- **Ensuring proper financial arrangements with your lender to fund the remainder of the project.**  \n\n---\n\n## **5. Financial Reconciliation (Final Accounting Before Closure)**  \nI will provide a **detailed breakdown of all project costs incurred to date, including:**  \n- **Permit fees, drafting costs, and administrative work related to approvals.**  \n- **Labor and material costs for completed work.**  \n- **Scope changes and their financial impact.**  \n\nWe will need to **resolve any outstanding financial obligations separately**, and I am open to discussing structured payment arrangements if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Communication & Boundaries Going Forward**  \n- All **communication must be via email** to ensure clarity and documentation.  \n- **No further phone calls** unless pre-scheduled for necessary discussions.  \n- **I will not be involved in contractor selection or ongoing project management** beyond submitting final plans.  \n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**  \n1. **Please confirm in writing** that you acknowledge this transition plan.  \n2. I will **submit the final revisions to ALDRAFT** and forward you an expected timeline.  \n3. Once plans are **finalized and approved by the county,** I will officially **handover the project to you.**  \n\nIf you have any questions, please document them in a reply email. I will not engage in further discussions outside of this structured process.  \n\n**This is the final transition plan, and there will be no further negotiations beyond these outlined steps.**  \n\nBest,  \nIbrahim  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Email Works:**\n✅ **Lays out all the facts**—Original scope, deviations, and what caused the issues.  \n✅ **Makes it clear you are stepping away**—Explicitly states why and sets a firm boundary.  \n✅ **Provides a structured exit plan**—Outlines what you will finish and what he must take over.  \n✅ **Eliminates ambiguity on finances**—States that costs will be reconciled separately.  \n✅ **Enforces communication boundaries**—Everything is to be documented in email, and no more unscheduled calls.  \n\nThis email ensures that you exit **cleanly, professionally, and with full documentation** to avoid further disputes.  \n\nWould you like me to help with the **financial breakdown document** next?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"ea2ef269-a44c-43a5-ae66-9ec6313493f8","request_id":"914cd8e12b766336-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ea2ef269-a44c-43a5-ae66-9ec6313493f8","children":["29c86651-f0f5-4a6b-acab-7b2d30d03641","4babbbc0-5147-4092-a9bc-fde51049ad01"]},"29c86651-f0f5-4a6b-acab-7b2d30d03641":{"id":"29c86651-f0f5-4a6b-acab-7b2d30d03641","message":{"id":"29c86651-f0f5-4a6b-acab-7b2d30d03641","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740037759.786388,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Rewrite it so that it maintains a conversational, intuitive flow, adapting to the emotional or intellectual intent of the question.

At this point, it’s obvious that this project has gone in a completely different direction than either of us originally planned. What started as a straightforward renovation has turned into something way more complicated—between the county’s requirements, unexpected structural issues, and all the changes along the way, it’s been a constant uphill battle.  \n\nFrom my end, I’ve tried to roll with it, but the reality is, I can’t keep moving forward like this. The financials don’t make sense, the process has become unpredictable, and I’ve reached a point where I need to step back. That being said, I don’t want to just leave things hanging, so here’s what I can do to make the transition as smooth as possible:  \n\nI’ll get the final plan revisions sent to ALDRAFT and make sure they reflect everything the county has been asking for. Once those are updated, I’ll submit them for approval. As soon as the county signs off, those finalized plans will be in your hands, and from there, you’ll be able to bring in whoever you choose to finish the job. That will officially wrap up my role in the project.  \n\nBeyond that, we’ll need to go over the financial side of things. I’ll send over a full breakdown of costs—what’s been spent, what changed, and how the numbers actually shake out. If there’s anything left to settle, we can figure out a reasonable way to handle it. But I want to be really clear: I can’t keep absorbing unexpected costs, and I can’t move forward without a structured financial plan.  \n\nAt this point, my focus is on tying up loose ends so you’re in the best position to move forward without me. I need everything related to the project to be handled over email from now on—no more last-minute calls or back-and-forth that isn’t documented. That way, there’s no miscommunication, and we both have a clear record of what’s happening.  \n\nLet me know that you’ve received this, and if you have any questions about next steps, put them in writing so we can address them properly. The goal here is to close things out in a way that’s fair and functional for both of us.  \n\nIbrahim  "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"29c86651-f0f5-4a6b-acab-7b2d30d03641","request_id":"914ce63bdcce6336-DFW","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"29c86651-f0f5-4a6b-acab-7b2d30d03641","children":[]},"4babbbc0-5147-4092-a9bc-fde51049ad01":{"id":"4babbbc0-5147-4092-a9bc-fde51049ad01","message":{"id":"4babbbc0-5147-4092-a9bc-fde51049ad01","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740037913.484072,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Rewrite it to avoid the rigid breakdown and structured flow"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"914ce9fc5c876336-DFW","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0ca3bf4b-453d-46c8-8ac3-caa1054af3fb","children":["90e9d5f6-c2af-4010-85f7-02a1f2d7b0bf"]},"90e9d5f6-c2af-4010-85f7-02a1f2d7b0bf":{"id":"90e9d5f6-c2af-4010-85f7-02a1f2d7b0bf","message":{"id":"90e9d5f6-c2af-4010-85f7-02a1f2d7b0bf","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740037936.972481,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Subject:** Finalizing Next Steps for 28W500 Kenwood  \n\nHey Mirza,  \n\nI wanted to put everything in writing so there’s no confusion about where things stand and what needs to happen next.  \n\nWhen we first discussed this project, the plan was to do a straightforward renovation that would allow you to move in quickly. But as things progressed, the situation changed—mainly because of the 203(k) loan requiring permits, which then triggered a whole set of county compliance issues that neither of us anticipated. That process added layers of complexity, additional costs, and time that weren’t part of the original scope. On top of that, multiple changes were made along the way, including additional windows, layout adjustments, and material substitutions, all of which further impacted the timeline and budget.  \n\nI’ve done my best to adapt, but at this point, I need to step away from the project. The financial side of this, the back and forth with the county, and the constant shifts in scope have made it impossible for me to continue in a way that’s sustainable. I know this hasn’t gone the way either of us expected, and I take responsibility for the things that could have been handled better on my end. But I also need to be realistic about what I can and can’t take on moving forward.  \n\nThat said, I’m not just walking away without tying up loose ends. I’ll take care of getting the necessary revisions submitted to ALDRAFT, and once those updates come back, I’ll submit them to the county for approval. Once the county signs off on the plans, I’ll send them over to you so you can move forward however you decide—whether that means hiring a new GC or coordinating the trades yourself.  \n\nBeyond that, we’ll also need to finalize where things stand financially. I’ll put together a breakdown of all costs to date, including work completed, permit fees, and everything else that’s been accounted for so far.

The initial goal was a straightforward renovation, and I made it clear from the start that I’m not an architect, I don’t deal with permitting, and I don’t have the overhead to handle back-and-forth coordination with the county. The only reason I took that on was as a favor because the 203(k) loan required permits, and that’s what set everything off in a direction that neither of us anticipated.  \n\nI gave you the best advice I could to avoid this—go with a hard money loan, use the cash you had to do minimal renovations, move in quickly, and refinance later. That would have avoided all of this. Instead, you went forward with the 203(k), which forced everything to be permitted, and that’s when we started running into issues with DuPage County, unexpected compliance requirements, and the project spiraling far beyond what it was supposed to be. On top of that, material selections, design choices, and scope changes added even more complexity that made it difficult to stay on track.  \n\nI’ve done what I can, but I can’t keep going in circles with revisions, coordination, and everything else that’s held this up. My role ends as soon as the plan modifications are submitted to **ALLDRAFT.** That’s the last thing I will assist with—ensuring the necessary changes are clearly marked so there are no misunderstandings when the plans come back. After that, it’s entirely on you to take things forward, including working with your lender and the county to remove my company from the permits and assign a new contractor or take on the permit yourself.  \n\nBeyond just the logistical issues, there have been fundamental problems in how this project has been handled. Repeated calls when I didn’t answer, reaching out to people who have nothing to do with the project—including my former business partner and even my wife—those are not things that happen in a professional setting. I need to be very clear that this is not how a contractor-client relationship works, and it’s one of the reasons why this situation became as difficult as it did. I’ve put in my best effort, given my best recommendations, and tried to adjust when things changed, but at the end of the day, we ended up here because of the decisions that were made along the way, not because I didn’t do my part.  \n\nThere’s fault on both sides, but the difference is that I came into this trying to make things as smooth as possible, and I was upfront about what I could and couldn’t do. If my original recommendations had been followed, this project would have been completed months ago. But that’s in the past now, and I need to make it absolutely clear that after the plans are submitted to ALLDRAFT, I will not be involved in any way—no more coordination, no further revisions, no ongoing involvement with the county, and no project management. Everything from that point forward is on you to handle.  \n\nI’ll be finalizing the plan notations shortly and will confirm once they’ve been sent. After that, any outstanding financial matters will need to be resolved separately. Let me know if you have any questions specific to that.

That process forced compliance with DuPage County regulations, which led to delays, additional costs, and required changes that neither of us had anticipated. On top of that, various scope changes—reconfiguring layouts, adding windows, and adjustments to material selections—complicated things even further.  \n\nI take responsibility for the areas where I could have handled things better. The work itself was never the issue, but I recognize that I gave too much leeway in allowing flexibility with materials, selections, and scope adjustments without having a structured process in place for handling change orders. While we had discussions about changes, I should have formalized them more clearly with written approvals to avoid confusion.  \n\nAnother challenge was the permitting and plan approval process, which required far more back-and-forth than I expected. The time and effort spent dealing with that process directly affected the project timeline and cost, which should have been communicated more effectively. I acknowledge that my ability to manage this was impacted by everything I had going on, and I take responsibility for not handling it as efficiently as I should have.  \n\nAt the same time, there were significant issues on your side that contributed to the situation we’re in now. Repeatedly calling me when I wasn’t available, contacting people who were not involved in the project—including my former business partner and my wife—was not appropriate or professional. These things added unnecessary tension and made it even harder to manage the project effectively. The decision to go with a 203(k) loan instead of a more flexible financing option led to complications that could have been avoided. And even after I advised on the best approach, the project kept expanding beyond what was initially agreed upon.  \n\nAt this point, I need to step away completely.

The last thing I need you to add in, which you can pull from the transcripts between me and my uncle and me and my wife, is that when we had a discussion about my personal issues and what I was going through, he had asked how he can help, and even before that we had made a plan about what needs to happen. And I was the one that had explained what needs to happen, and what needed to happen was that we needed to mark up the plans to reflect the actual work. And along with the structural engineer's report, and then submit that to the county for approval. Once we had that approval in place, then we could continue as needed. Almost two months out from when we had originally discussed this, and we're back in the same position. The plan that I had originally put in place, which was make changes to the approved plans, revise them, get them submitted to ALDRAFT, submit the plans to the county, and then do the work according to the plan. That still needs to be done. And you had asked me what I needed help with, and I had specified that I need you to mark up those plans, send them back to me, I'll review them, or mark up those plans and send them to ALDRAFT. Get them submitted. I don't know why that didn't happen, but that's what needed to happen, and that's still what needs to happen now. And I think that was the final straw, was that I had put this plan in place originally, indicating that I knew what needed to happen based on the events that had transpired. And after everything that had happened in between, you reaching out to other people, trying to get different quotes, you know, handle it, calling the inspector to come out and clarify everything, which, by the way, I had already done. We are still in the same place. We are still in the same place. And so that would indicate that the plan that I had originally put in place was the most effective and correct course of action that needed to happen two months ago. Two months ago, without all of the stuff in between. And when you had asked me what I needed help with and I told you, instead of trying to force work to get done, then and following the plans that I had put in place, we wouldn't be in this situation. But you had forced work to start going on. I got a framing crew out there. And yet again, we still need to submit the plans. So logic would tell you that I was right, I knew what needed to happen, I just couldn't execute on it because of what was going on.

That process forced compliance with DuPage County regulations, which led to delays, additional costs, and required changes that neither of us had anticipated. On top of that, various scope changes—reconfiguring layouts, adding windows, and adjustments to material selections—complicated things even further.  \n\nI take responsibility for the areas where I could have handled things better. The work itself was never the issue, but I recognize that I gave too much leeway in allowing flexibility with materials, selections, and scope adjustments without having a structured process in place for handling change orders. While we had discussions about changes, I should have formalized them more clearly with written approvals to avoid confusion.  \n\nAnother challenge was the permitting and plan approval process, which required far more back-and-forth than I expected. The time and effort spent dealing with that process directly affected the project timeline and cost, which should have been communicated more effectively. I acknowledge that my ability to manage this was impacted by everything I had going on, and I take responsibility for not handling it as efficiently as I should have.  \n\nAt the same time, there were significant issues on your side that contributed to the situation we’re in now. Repeatedly calling me when I wasn’t available, contacting people who were not involved in the project—including my former business partner and my wife—was not appropriate or professional. These things added unnecessary tension and made it even harder to manage the project effectively. The decision to go with a 203(k) loan instead of a more flexible financing option led to complications that could have been avoided. And even after I advised on the best approach, the project kept expanding beyond what was initially agreed upon.  \n\nBut what ultimately led me to this decision was the pattern of not following the plan I had originally put in place. Months ago, I clearly outlined what needed to happen:  \n- The plans needed to be marked up to reflect the actual work.  \n- Those marked-up plans, along with the structural engineer’s report, needed to be submitted to ALLDRAFT.  \n- Once revised plans were completed, they needed to be submitted to the county for approval.  \n- After county approval, work could proceed according to the finalized plan.  \n\nThat plan was never followed, and now, nearly two months later, we are in the same position. In between, you tried to move things forward in a different way—bringing in other contractors, reaching out for additional quotes, calling the inspector to clarify things (which I had already done), and pushing for work to start before the plans were finalized. I got a framing crew out there to accommodate that, but despite all of that effort, we are still stuck at the same point: the plans still need to be submitted.  \n\nYou had asked me what I needed help with, and I told you exactly what needed to happen. If those steps had been followed, we wouldn’t be here. Instead, the process deviated, work was pushed forward prematurely, and now we’re back to what I originally outlined as the necessary course of action. The fact that we are still at this point only reinforces that my initial plan was the right one. The issue wasn’t that I didn’t know what needed to be done—it was that I couldn’t execute on it due to everything I had going on. When you asked how you could help, I gave you the steps, and they still weren’t done.  \n\nAt this point, I need to step away completely.

And we did not finalize any of the plans, we didn't finalize any of the, the main thing was we didn't finalize the plans and the permitting before he had to start making mortgage payments.

This pattern consists of **not following recommendations**, **introducing unnecessary complexity**, **acting reactively rather than proactively**, and **ultimately ending up at the same roadblocks that could have been avoided** if the original plan had been followed. Below is a structured breakdown of this behavior:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Dismissing Initial Financial Advice & Choosing a More Complex Route**\n- **Your Recommendation:**  \n  - Avoid a **203(k) renovation loan** because of the red tape and lender restrictions.  \n  - Instead, **secure a conventional loan or a hard money loan**, which would have allowed flexibility and reduced permitting complications.  \n  - Use **cash on hand** to renovate as minimally as possible, move in, then refinance.\n  \n- **Mirza’s Actions:**  \n  - Ignored the recommendation and proceeded with a 203(k) loan, which **tied the project to the permit process** and **forced a strict draw schedule**, making things significantly more complicated.  \n  - This decision **started the clock on mortgage payments before the plans and permits were finalized**, leading to ongoing financial pressure.  \n\n- **End Result:**  \n  - Delays and financial stress that could have been avoided.  \n  - Permit requirements forced additional, unplanned scope increases.  \n  - The project became **reactive rather than planned**, leading to increased costs and inefficiencies.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ignoring the Original Plan for Finalizing Plans & Permits Before Work**\n- **Your Recommendation:**  \n  - The plan was clear:  \n    1. **Mark up the plans** to reflect actual work.  \n    2. **Submit those plans to ALLDRAFT** for revisions.  \n    3. **Submit the revised plans to the county** for approval.  \n    4. **Only after approval, start work.**  \n\n- **Mirza’s Actions:**  \n  - Did **not** mark up the plans as needed.  \n  - Failed to follow through with submitting revisions to ALLDRAFT.  \n  - Instead of finalizing the permit process first, **pushed for work to start prematurely**.  \n  - Spent time reaching out to **other contractors and inspectors**, creating **disruptions and additional confusion**.  \n  - Forced a framing crew to begin work **before the necessary approvals were in place**.\n\n- **End Result:**  \n  - The project **ended up back at the same point**—plans still needing to be submitted to ALLDRAFT.  \n  - Delays, rework, and **wasted time** that could have been avoided.  \n  - Additional unnecessary costs.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Repeatedly Seeking Alternative Opinions Instead of Following Guidance**\n- **Your Recommendation:**  \n  - The best approach was already outlined **(plans → ALLDRAFT → county approval → execution).**  \n  - Inspections and planning had already been **discussed and clarified.**  \n\n- **Mirza’s Actions:**  \n  - **Ignored that guidance** and sought other opinions, despite clear instructions.  \n  - Reached out to:  \n    - **Inspectors for clarifications** that were already obtained.  \n    - **Other contractors for quotes**, **despite the work already being in progress**.  \n    - **Your uncle and other mutual contacts**, trying to involve third parties instead of directly following the original process.  \n    - **Your former business partner and even your wife**, which was highly inappropriate.  \n\n- **End Result:**  \n  - Wasted time, confusion, and unnecessary involvement of people who were not part of the project.  \n  - The same steps still needed to be completed, meaning no real progress was made despite the additional effort.  \n  - Further strained the professional relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Inconsistent Decision-Making & Scope Creep**\n- **Your Recommendation:**  \n  - Stick to the original scope and **avoid unnecessary complexity**.  \n  - Use standard, contractor-supplied materials to **simplify procurement and maintain quality control**.  \n  - Any changes should be **clearly documented with change orders**.  \n\n- **Mirza’s Actions:**  \n  - Went on **Facebook Marketplace to buy materials**, including **used windows, tile, and vanities**.  \n  - Pushed for additional changes **(heated floors, extra windows, bathroom reconfiguration, etc.)** while simultaneously **complaining about cost increases**.  \n  - Ignored the structure of your pricing and procurement process, leading to **logistical and quality issues**.  \n\n- **End Result:**  \n  - Increased project complexity, supply chain issues, and a **breakdown in financial clarity**.  \n  - Your ability to properly track material costs and change orders was undermined.  \n  - **Project costs ballooned**, leading to further financial strain.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Ignoring Boundaries & Professionalism in Communication**\n- **Your Expectation:**  \n  - Maintain a professional **contractor-client relationship**.  \n  - Respect communication boundaries.  \n  - Limit contact to relevant project discussions.  \n\n- **Mirza’s Actions:**  \n  - **Repeatedly called you excessively**, even after being told you weren’t available.  \n  - **Ignored your request for email-based communication**.  \n  - **Contacted your former business partner and wife**—crossing professional boundaries and introducing personal stress.  \n  - Failed to respect your **burnout and health concerns**, even after acknowledging them.  \n\n- **End Result:**  \n  - Created unnecessary stress and **strained the working relationship**.  \n  - Compounded difficulties by adding **unnecessary emotional and personal tension**.  \n  - Instead of improving communication, it **added more roadblocks** to getting the project completed.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways from the Pattern**\n1. **Repeatedly disregards expert guidance** → You laid out clear, practical steps, and he consistently went in a different direction.  \n2. **Takes actions that add unnecessary complexity** → Buying secondhand materials, adding last-minute changes, seeking unnecessary third-party opinions.  \n3. **Works reactively rather than proactively** → Made decisions under financial pressure instead of planning ahead.  \n4. **Ignores clear boundaries and expectations** → Excessive calls, involvement of unrelated parties, and lack of professionalism in communication.  \n5. **Ends up back at the same roadblocks that could have been avoided** → The project is **still** where it was **two months ago**, proving that your original plan was correct all along.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThis **isn’t just an isolated issue—it’s a pattern of behavior**. Every time a recommendation was given, it was ignored in favor of an alternative approach that ultimately failed and led back to **the exact same place you originally advised him to start from**. The project’s biggest delays and complications have been a **direct result of that pattern**, not a result of the work itself.  \n\nHad the **initial financial recommendation** been followed,  \nHad the **plans been finalized before mortgage payments began**,  \nHad the **permit approval been obtained before work started**,  \nHad the **scope been controlled and material sourcing been handled properly**,  \nHad the **agreed-upon communication boundaries been respected**,  \n\n**None of these major issues would have happened.**  \n\nAt this point, you are making the **only logical decision**—stepping away after submitting the revised plans to ALLDRAFT.

The primary focus here is identifying the **pattern of Mirza Baig not following your recommendations** and how that contributed to the current state of the project.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **203(k) Loan vs. Simpler Financing**\n### *What You Recommended:*  \n- A **hard money loan** or a **conventional mortgage** followed by minimal renovations and a quick refinance. This approach would have allowed him to do the bare minimum—essentially **paint, flooring, and any pressing repairs**—and then move into the house quickly.\n\n### *What Happened Instead:*  \n- Mirza **opted for a 203(k) loan**.  \n- This **mandated pulling permits**, which triggered **strict county regulations** and required **extensive code compliance**.  \n- Because the 203(k) loan wrapped renovation costs into the mortgage, he **had to start making mortgage payments immediately**, even though **plans and permits** were not finalized.  \n- As a result, **every delay and scope change** turned into added financial pressure for him, **intensifying** the situation for both of you.\n\n**Pattern:** He disregarded your advice about simpler financing and chose a loan structure that **forced** the project into a more complex route, leading to **unnecessary complications**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Pulling Permits & Completing Plans Before Starting Work**\n### *What You Recommended:*  \n- **Finalize architectural plans** and get the permit **approved** *before* doing any construction work.  \n- **Mark up** the plans to reflect the *actual* work needed, especially after the structural engineer’s feedback.  \n- Once the county *approved* these updated plans, **then** proceed with construction and trades.\n\n### *What Happened Instead:*  \n- Mirza **pushed for work to start** (framing, electrical, plumbing) *before* finalizing and submitting the revised plans to the county.  \n- He also **brought in third parties**—other contractors for quotes, inspectors—trying to get the house moving along **outside** the system you advised.  \n- The project got **bogged down** when inspectors found unapproved or out-of-scope work, causing **further delays** and **rework**.\n\n**Pattern:** Despite your **clear plan** to finalize permits before doing major work, he repeatedly **jumped ahead**, creating **layers of rework and confusion**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Strict Communication & Project Management Boundaries**\n### *What You Recommended:*  \n- A **formal change order** process for any new materials or scope changes.  \n- **Minimal flexibility** in selecting materials (e.g., offering a few standard tile options).  \n- Keeping **project communication** focused and professional—no calling unrelated third parties, no late-night phone sprees.  \n- **Written agreements** for additional work, plus **structured scheduling** of phone calls if necessary.\n\n### *What Happened Instead:*  \n- Mirza bought **used tiles, windows, and other materials** from **Facebook Marketplace**, complicating the planning and budgeting.  \n- He **demanded** (or at least strongly pushed for) additional, **unplanned** changes—like adding heated floors—*while* complaining about cost overruns.  \n- He **contacted your wife** and **former business partner**—people who had nothing to do with the project—causing **professional boundary issues**.  \n- He would **blow up your phone** with repeated calls, ignoring your request for **scheduled communication**.\n\n**Pattern:** He **ignored** your protocols on communication and scope changes, creating a chaotic environment and contributing to **budget creep** and **miscommunication**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Scope & Budget Containment**\n### *What You Recommended:*  \n- Keeping the renovation to **only** essential items:  \n  - Basic reconfigurations  \n  - Light cosmetic changes  \n  - No major structural or layout overhauls without additional budget.  \n- **Documenting** and **charging** for each new request or change order promptly.\n\n### *What Happened Instead:*  \n- He repeatedly **expanded** the scope (extra windows, changed bathroom layouts, new plumbing, etc.).  \n- **Ballpark** discussions were made for some changes, but he **never signed** formal change orders.  \n- You eventually sent a **batch of change orders** all at once, leading to **shock and disputes** over costs.  \n- His method of **“penny smart, dollar foolish”**—trying to save money on materials but causing **bigger** budget issues down the line—further complicated the project.\n\n**Pattern:** He **pushed** for additional features or changes while **resisting** formal documentation and complaining about cost, leading to a **lack of clarity** and **financial disagreements**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Timeline & Overlapping Personal Stresses**\n### *What You Recommended:*  \n- Address **permit and plan revisions** calmly and systematically, understanding it would take time.  \n- **Respect** your personal situation and capacity limits.\n\n### *What Happened Instead:*  \n- Because mortgage payments started **immediately** (due to the 203(k) loan structure), Mirza kept **pressuring** the project to move faster than the plans and permits allowed.  \n- You, meanwhile, became **overwhelmed** with personal issues—**health, ADHD burnout, staff quitting**—and **couldn’t** handle the constant demands.  \n- Mirza’s additional pressure (excessive calls, bringing in other people, etc.) further **exacerbated** your personal stress.\n\n**Pattern:** Even after you **explained** your limitations and asked for help (like marking up plans), he **did not follow through**. The stress kept piling up because **his mortgage payments** and your **burnout** collided.\n\n---\n\n# **Overall Pattern of Not Following Recommendations**\n\n- **Financing Approach:**  \n  He **rejected** your simpler financing advice, creating **unnecessary** complexities with a 203(k) loan.  \n- **Permit & Plan Adherence:**  \n  He **skipped** finalizing or modifying plans before jumping into the work, causing **rework** and **inspections** to fail.  \n- **Communication & Boundaries:**  \n  He **ignored** structured communication, repeatedly called uninvited, and **contacted irrelevant parties**, generating **conflict** and **confusion**.  \n- **Scope & Budget Control:**  \n  He **continued** to add features, buy strange materials, and make changes **without** signing formal change orders or acknowledging added costs.  \n- **Ignoring Clear Action Plans:**  \n  The **plan** you gave (marking up plans, updating them via ALLDRAFT, re-submitting to the county) was **never fully implemented**, leading to a **stalled project**.  \n\nThrough every stage, **Mirza Baig** had a **consistent pattern** of:\n\n1. **Failing** to follow the clear steps you laid out,  \n2. **Forcing** work to happen out of sequence,  \n3. **Rejecting** or ignoring your professional advice in favor of short-term solutions, and  \n4. **Adding** new demands (and changes) that contradicted the original plan and timeline.\n\nThis pattern has resulted in **continuous delays, increased costs**, and a **breakdown** in the working relationship."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"9a8f7a4d-263b-4aca-a175-86c741f6e573","request_id":"91506e7d8dbf631b-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9a8f7a4d-263b-4aca-a175-86c741f6e573","children":["1e9308b6-328a-4610-8bb9-3418de2ddf72"]},"1e9308b6-328a-4610-8bb9-3418de2ddf72":{"id":"1e9308b6-328a-4610-8bb9-3418de2ddf72","message":{"id":"1e9308b6-328a-4610-8bb9-3418de2ddf72","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075150.515337,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Again, analyze the same transcripts as well as your previous response and tell me how I should have addressed these issues as they came up to keep control of the situation and avoided where we ultimately ended up."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"915077179a65e80d-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"debfb13e-52ba-4a4c-b6fb-572090692716","children":["d8c16608-ddd8-408a-ac42-e09f9bc65ff7"]},"d8c16608-ddd8-408a-ac42-e09f9bc65ff7":{"id":"d8c16608-ddd8-408a-ac42-e09f9bc65ff7","message":{"id":"d8c16608-ddd8-408a-ac42-e09f9bc65ff7","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075200.714516,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for a couple of seconds","initial_text":"Reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"1e9308b6-328a-4610-8bb9-3418de2ddf72","request_id":"915077179a65e80d-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"1e9308b6-328a-4610-8bb9-3418de2ddf72","children":["d33865ef-338d-431e-8c7d-97483a615678"]},"d33865ef-338d-431e-8c7d-97483a615678":{"id":"d33865ef-338d-431e-8c7d-97483a615678","message":{"id":"d33865ef-338d-431e-8c7d-97483a615678","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075200.714656,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Below is an **analysis** of how you *could* have addressed the various issues with Mirza Baig as they arose—based on the transcripts, your previous explanations, and standard project management practices—in order to keep control of the situation and avoid the ultimate breakdown.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Financing Approach & 203(k) Loan Issues**\n\n### **Issue**  \nMirza chose a **203(k) loan**, which tied everything to permitted work and forced him to start mortgage payments right away. This created **constant financial pressure** that drove impulsive decisions.\n\n### **What Could Have Been Done Differently**  \n1. **Red Flag the 203(k) Loan Immediately**  \n   - You did voice concerns, but you could have made it a **non-negotiable** that you wouldn’t take on a 203(k)-funded renovation unless the permit process was **100% resolved first**.  \n   - By *firmly* refusing to proceed without a **clear financing structure** (draw schedule, holdbacks, etc.), you might have avoided being stuck fronting costs and dealing with endless red tape.\n\n2. **Set a Hard Start Date**  \n   - **No work begins** (including design and planning) until the **financing** is clearly spelled out.  \n   - If Mirza insisted on a 203(k) loan, you could have required an **upfront retainer** or a **reserve for plan revisions** so you weren’t left holding the bag when changes inevitably arose.\n\n### **Key Takeaway**  \nYou warned him, but **didn’t set hard boundaries** around your willingness (or ability) to navigate 203(k) complexities. Making it a **deal-breaker** if he insisted on starting prematurely could have saved you the headache.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Permits, Plans, & Following a Proper Sequence**\n\n### **Issue**  \nDespite your **clear plan**—finalize architectural plans, get county approval, *then* do the work—Mirza kept pushing you to start work early, brought in other contractors, and called inspectors before the plans were finished.\n\n### **What Could Have Been Done Differently**  \n1. **Enforce a “No Permit, No Hammer” Rule**  \n   - From the outset, be explicit: **“I will not start any physical work until the updated plans are approved by the county.”**  \n   - If Mirza tried to bypass this, you could have paused the project **completely** until he complied.\n\n2. **Insist on a Written Change Order Process**  \n   - For every new idea he had—windows, layout changes, heated floors, etc.—require a **signed change order** *before* proceeding.  \n   - If he refused, **do not proceed** with the extra work.  \n   - This prevents confusion and offers you a **paper trail** showing how the scope (and cost) changed.\n\n3. **Upfront Communication about Timelines**  \n   - You did explain the need for markups and re-submission, but each time it stalled, you could have sent an **official pause notice**:  \n     - “Project on hold until XYZ is completed.”  \n   - That forces the client to either **comply** or **formally acknowledge** the delay in writing.\n\n### **Key Takeaway**  \nYou had the *right* sequence in mind, but **didn’t firmly enforce** it. Providing a clear consequence—**“If you do not follow this process, I will stop all work”**—would have helped keep the project on track or ended it before you sank more resources into it.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Communication & Boundary Issues**\n\n### **Issue**  \nMirza often **blew up your phone**, involved third parties (your wife, ex-partner), and made decisions without consulting you. This led to chaos, mistrust, and unprofessional exchanges.\n\n### **What Could Have Been Done Differently**  \n1. **Formal Communication Policy from Day One**  \n   - Present a **written policy**:  \n     - “All project updates are via email, any phone calls must be scheduled, no after-hours contact.”  \n   - If he violated these boundaries, **remind him in writing**. If it continued, **pause the project**.\n\n2. **Refuse to Engage with Non-Involved Parties**  \n   - As soon as you learned he called your wife, you could have told Mirza:  \n     - “This is unprofessional. I will not continue if you contact anyone outside the project.”  \n   - By **stopping work** at that point, you send a clear message that you **won’t tolerate** such oversteps.\n\n3. **Enforce Consequences**  \n   - If he repeatedly ignored protocol—calling day and night, reaching out to random people—then you **halt** the project until he acknowledges and respects your policy.\n\n### **Key Takeaway**  \nSet strict lines of communication and enforce them **early**. Mirza’s contacting outsiders and constant calls without repercussions signaled he could **get away** with boundary violations.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Material Selections & Scope Creep**\n\n### **Issue**  \nMirza kept buying random materials from **Facebook Marketplace**, requesting new windows, reconfiguring bathrooms—all of which ballooned costs and complicated the schedule.\n\n### **What Could Have Been Done Differently**  \n1. **Fixed Material Allowances**  \n   - In your **original contract**, specify: “**All materials must be sourced through me** or a supplier I approve. If you choose an alternate source, we must sign a new agreement and adjust cost/time accordingly before ordering.”  \n   - If he brings used tile from Marketplace, that’s **outside** the original agreement—**no** installation without a signed change order.  \n\n2. **Immediate Cost Revisions for Every Change**  \n   - “Here’s the cost to install your used windows, here’s the revised schedule.”  \n   - If he balks, you don’t do the work until it’s **paid upfront**.\n\n3. **Clear Warranties & Liability**  \n   - If he insists on using unknown materials, disclaim **all warranties**.  \n   - This typically discourages such cost-saving gambits when the client realizes **you won’t be responsible** for problems down the line.\n\n### **Key Takeaway**  \nEach scope creep needed an **immediate** cost and time adjustment in writing. By letting changes slide without formal documentation, you lost control over the budget and timeline.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Personal Overwhelm & Burnout**\n\n### **Issue**  \nYou were dealing with ADHD, personal financial struggles, staff quitting, and emotional burnout. Meanwhile, Mirza’s **mortgage pressure** and personal anxieties added fuel to the fire.\n\n### **What Could Have Been Done Differently**  \n1. **Delegate or Bring in Help**  \n   - If you were overwhelmed, consider hiring an **architectural liaison** or a **permit expeditor**.  \n   - Let them handle the red tape so you **don’t** get buried in it.\n\n2. **Set Clear Capacity Limits**  \n   - “I can only handle X hours of permit coordination per week. If more is required, we’ll need additional resources or a consultant.”  \n   - If Mirza wouldn’t pay for extra help, you had **grounds** to back out due to insufficient resources.\n\n3. **Stop the Project If Overloaded**  \n   - The minute you realized you **couldn’t** juggle it, you could have suspended the project until you were stable.  \n   - This might have forced Mirza to **accept** the realities of the timeline or find another contractor.\n\n### **Key Takeaway**  \nYour personal struggles required you to **protect your bandwidth**. By continuing despite burnout, you allowed the project to **spiral**, and Mirza capitalized on your lack of energy to maintain boundaries.\n\n---\n\n# **Putting It All Together: Maintaining Control**\n\n1. **Non-Negotiable Financing & Permit Conditions**  \n   - Refuse to engage without either (a) an *approved* permit or (b) a *secure* financing plan that covers potential overruns.  \n2. **Stringent Documentation & Change Orders**  \n   - Every new request = immediate scope/cost/time revision.  \n   - No handshake deals—everything in writing, signed by both parties.  \n3. **Communication Boundaries & Consequences**  \n   - Provide a **written policy** for phone calls, texts, and emails.  \n   - If violated, **pause** until respected.  \n4. **Upfront Material Rules**  \n   - Define what you will supply vs. what the client can supply, with a clear **no-supply/no-warranty** policy.  \n5. **Capacity & Health Considerations**  \n   - Be transparent: if you cannot handle a large permitting job, don’t agree to it.  \n   - Outsource or partner with someone who can manage the complexities if you want the project.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nHad you enforced these measures right away and followed through with **pauses or termination** whenever Mirza disregarded them, you either would have:\n\n- Forced him to **comply** with a professional, organized process, *or*  \n- Ended the arrangement **before** sinking too many resources and energy.\n\nIn **every** instance you described, you had the right instincts—insisting on finalized plans, cautioning about the 203(k) loan, wanting to formalize change orders—but you **didn’t enforce** them with strict policies and clear consequences. Doing so would have preserved your control, your health, and ultimately saved both parties a lot of stress."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"d8c16608-ddd8-408a-ac42-e09f9bc65ff7","request_id":"915077179a65e80d-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d8c16608-ddd8-408a-ac42-e09f9bc65ff7","children":["15474939-2b6a-4637-98df-f1d23d8c4d5a"]},"15474939-2b6a-4637-98df-f1d23d8c4d5a":{"id":"15474939-2b6a-4637-98df-f1d23d8c4d5a","message":{"id":"15474939-2b6a-4637-98df-f1d23d8c4d5a","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075498.595453,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Now rewrite the last email to include all of what we discussed without pointing fingers or trying to play a blame game.

I gave too much flexibility on materials and scope changes without always having a formal process for change orders, and I underestimated how much time and administrative work the permit and plan approvals would require. My own personal circumstances made it harder to manage the back-and-forth when the project expanded, and I should have reinforced certain boundaries more firmly from the start.\n\nAt the same time, once the 203(k) structure required everything to be tied to the permit process, the county’s strict requirements and the ongoing scope revisions became a challenge neither of us fully anticipated. We ended up with a situation where work sometimes began before plans were fully approved, and multiple changes—such as reconfiguring rooms, adding windows, and sourcing materials outside of the original plan—caused costs and timelines to shift repeatedly. These issues could likely have been reduced if we had finalized the plans and permitting steps up front, but we both moved forward under tight timelines and mounting personal pressures.\n\nMoving forward, I need to step away completely. I will help ensure any remaining plan modifications are clearly outlined and submitted to **ALLDRAFT**, but once that’s done, I won’t be involved further. After the plans are resubmitted, you’ll need to coordinate with the county, work with your lender to remove my company from the permits, and decide on a path forward—whether hiring a new contractor or managing any trades yourself.\n\nFor clarity and transparency, all future communication should be by email with **Nisar (cc’d)** included. I won’t be available for phone calls or texts. If a phone conversation ever becomes necessary, it needs to be recorded and have a third party present, ideally Nisar. I will also prepare a detailed breakdown of costs incurred to date so you have a clear accounting of what has been done and what expenses were covered. Any remaining financial matters will need to be handled separately once the plan changes are submitted.\n\nI appreciate the work that has already gone into this house and the efforts made. I genuinely hoped it would turn out more smoothly for both of us. If there’s anything specifically related to finalizing the plan revisions, feel free to email with Nisar cc’d, and I’ll do my best to provide any clarification needed before I completely step away.\n\nThank you,\n\nIbrahim  "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"65df73e9-2443-4851-96eb-725acc9d8b0d","request_id":"91507f985bdccc6e-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"65df73e9-2443-4851-96eb-725acc9d8b0d","children":["2f88766f-c23a-435e-a8d4-4024b88a8169"]},"2f88766f-c23a-435e-a8d4-4024b88a8169":{"id":"2f88766f-c23a-435e-a8d4-4024b88a8169","message":{"id":"2f88766f-c23a-435e-a8d4-4024b88a8169","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075655.969262,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["This is great, but I want to document the issues of why I'm stepping away more clearly."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"915083700ff8cc6e-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a1de995d-6ea9-46e3-bb0e-390abcc401ce","children":["a17d9c1a-40c9-4eb5-8c72-1227fb408c78"]},"a17d9c1a-40c9-4eb5-8c72-1227fb408c78":{"id":"a17d9c1a-40c9-4eb5-8c72-1227fb408c78","message":{"id":"a17d9c1a-40c9-4eb5-8c72-1227fb408c78","author":{"role":"tool","name":"a8km123","metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075667.731123,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0,"metadata":{"finished_text":"Reasoned for a couple of seconds","initial_text":"Reasoning","message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"2f88766f-c23a-435e-a8d4-4024b88a8169","request_id":"915083700ff8cc6e-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2f88766f-c23a-435e-a8d4-4024b88a8169","children":["c0b8434b-c8ae-4527-a6dd-ea8c8c573559"]},"c0b8434b-c8ae-4527-a6dd-ea8c8c573559":{"id":"c0b8434b-c8ae-4527-a6dd-ea8c8c573559","message":{"id":"c0b8434b-c8ae-4527-a6dd-ea8c8c573559","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740075667.731251,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["**Subject:** Transition and Next Steps for 28W500 Kenwood\n\nMirza,\n\nI’m writing to clarify where we stand, acknowledge the issues that led to this point, and outline how we’ll proceed.

In the beginning, before we even started any work, after the final decision to go with the 203k loan and solidified the need for permits, I advised him that I am not an architect, and for permits to, for the necessary permits, we would need to draw up as-built plans and then propose changes and so on and so forth. And I had also mentioned that this is not something that I handle. And the only reason I'm doing it, or I'm taking this responsibility, is because it was a requirement of the 203k lender. That being said, at that time, I had significantly underestimated the amount of time and effort it would take To, time, effort, and money it would take to get us to a point where we had approved plans. As we both were unaware of the strict processes and increased timelines required by, or not required by, but that the county had implemented, or whatever the correct word is. So that's for the permanent plan approval sequence. But that part that you're mentioning, that was not the beginning. I had emphasized finalizing the plans and securing county approval before starting major work. This is after, like, we got approved plans, after the plumber came out and did all of the rough plumbing, and then what ended up happening was that we called for a rough plumbing inspection, and the plumbing inspector noted issues with the ceiling joists, where the plumbing was running through. These issues had to do with pre-existing notches and notches and holes done by the plumber. Because of this, and because of the word of that inspector, we were then required to go and repair all of these joists. I acknowledge that there were other joists that were notched in different areas of the house that were due to the previous electrician. But that wasn't what this plumbing inspector was pointing out. This plumbing inspector mainly was pointing out notches from many layers of previous work that had been done in that area of the house. Now, I knew the correct way to reinforce those joists, which ended up being the method that we went with anyways, which was to sister them. And I could have easily gotten that taken care of, and we could have moved forward. But the main issue lied in the fact that the plumbing inspector had notated those issues on the permit and notated that an architect or structural engineer would be required to inspect and provide an approved repair. And that would have to be submitted to the county for review. After that, because of this process, We had went ahead and called for the next set of inspections, which was electrical and framing, even though we knew we were not ready, so we could have the inspector come out and talk to him, which I did. And I talked to the inspector, I took direction from him, and I relayed that direction to you, which was that the inspector will require the plans to reflect the work in its entirety, which means the number of fixtures, the type of fixtures, the type of outlets, bringing everything up to code, etc. And we had agreed on the proper path to move forward, which was to come up with a set of markups that we would submit back to ALDRAFT, along with the structural engineer's report, so they could then prepare a revision that we could submit back to the county for approval. And this was what I had suggested, this entire process. You had then asked, and were always concerned with, getting the work started once the plan was in place. My thought was to avoid any rework. I'm familiar with the proper methods of remodeling and construction, which is how I was able to articulate and come to the conclusion of what needs to be done, and how, and explain that process to you. The issue is that, once we needed to submit a revised set of plans, we should not have continued any work until we received final approval from the plans, from the county. However, it is my understanding that because of the clock that started ticking as soon as you closed on your 203k loan, and the fact that you had to make mortgage payments, there was significant pressure to continue the work without regard for the correct process.

This project started as a straightforward renovation concept, but from the outset, the plan was tied to a 203(k) loan—which I initially advised against, due to the strict permitting and potential delays it could introduce. Once the county’s extensive regulations came into play, and multiple scope changes were introduced—such as reconfiguring rooms, adding windows, and bringing in various materials—both the timeline and costs grew beyond what we initially expected.\n\nThroughout this project, I noticed certain recommendations I made were not followed, which contributed to where we are now:\n\n1. **Financing & Loan Choice**  \n   I suggested a simpler approach (e.g., a conventional or hard money loan, or very minimal renovations) to avoid the extensive permit requirements. Opting to proceed with the 203(k) meant all work hinged on county approval, which added more red tape and delays—especially once mortgage payments started before final plans were approved.\n\n2. **Permit & Plan Approval Sequence**  \n   From the moment it was confirmed that permits would be needed, I made it clear I’m not an architect and typically don’t handle as-built drawings, permit applications, or the back-and-forth with municipalities. I only took on this responsibility because it was required by your lender. Initially, both of us underestimated how much time, effort, and money would be needed to draft and finalize the plans under DuPage County’s strict processes.  \n   - After rough plumbing was installed and the plumbing inspector noted issues with pre-existing notches and holes in the joists, the county required an architect or structural engineer to approve and submit a repair plan.  \n   - At that point, I clarified we’d need to update the approved plans to reflect the actual work: correct fixture counts, new items added, and the structural engineer’s report. Those revised plans would then have to go back to **ALLDRAFT** and ultimately be resubmitted to the county for final approval.  \n   - Despite my recommendation to pause further work until the updated plans were approved, the financial pressure of monthly mortgage payments led to attempts at pushing the project forward sooner, which caused additional rework and ongoing delays.\n\n3. **Scope Changes & Materials**  \n   I encouraged a formalized process for change orders to track how new windows, altered layouts, or different materials would affect cost and timing. However, ongoing adjustments—often introduced without a strict change-order procedure—kept shifting the budget and schedule, leading to confusion and mismatched expectations.\n\n4. **Communication & Boundaries**  \n   I asked that communication remain structured and professional, but there were times I received numerous calls in quick succession, and individuals not tied to the project (my former business partner, my wife) were contacted. This added stress and did not help us resolve the core permit and scope challenges more quickly.\n\nI also acknowledge my own shortcomings. I should have enforced firmer boundaries from the beginning about when and how work would proceed, especially once we saw how demanding DuPage County’s requirements were. My personal situation and workload made it difficult to continually oversee an expanding project that required repeated plan updates, inspections, and approvals.  \n\nMeanwhile, both of us have been under personal and financial strains—yours tied to mortgage obligations under the 203(k) structure, mine due to a range of factors that impacted my capacity. In hindsight, we could have better contained these challenges if we had finalized the permit steps and kept a tighter rein on financing and scope before diving into construction.\n\nAt this point, I will finalize any remaining plan modifications for submission to **ALLDRAFT** so the revisions are accurately documented. After that, I’ll be stepping away. You’ll need to handle further county requirements, remove my company from the permits through your lender, and decide on your next course of action—whether hiring a new contractor or coordinating trades yourself.\n\nFor clarity and transparency, all future communication must be by email with **Nisar (cc’d)** included. I won’t be available by phone or text. If a phone call ever becomes absolutely necessary, it must be recorded and include a third party (preferably Nisar). I will also provide a detailed breakdown of costs so you have a clear accounting of everything done to date. Any outstanding financial matters will be addressed separately once the plan updates are submitted.\n\nI appreciate the efforts that have gone into this house and recognize work was put in on both sides. If you have questions specifically about finalizing the plan revisions, please email me (with Nisar cc’d), and I’ll do my best to assist before my involvement ends.\n\nThank you,  \nIbrahim"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"cc628d13-1059-44b9-bd31-8d6afa356de4","request_id":"915299a10b2f13f3-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cc628d13-1059-44b9-bd31-8d6afa356de4","children":["5fee2736-a66c-407f-a790-61866d5c041c"]},"5fee2736-a66c-407f-a790-61866d5c041c":{"id":"5fee2736-a66c-407f-a790-61866d5c041c","message":{"id":"5fee2736-a66c-407f-a790-61866d5c041c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740098118.493538,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["0.3 and 0.4 are not things that I encouraged or did.

I understand you needed answers, but these actions were inappropriate and further contributed to the tension.\n\nDespite these issues, I acknowledge my own shortcomings: I underestimated the workload involved, didn’t enforce stricter boundaries and processes, and let the project expand without fully recalibrating the budget and timeline.

They capture the key themes from all our discussions so you can **cover everything** in a calm, structured way **without** reading a formal email:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Project Background & Financing**\n\n- **203(k) Loan Caution**  \n  - “From the beginning, I advised a simpler loan or minimal renovations to avoid the strict permitting process. The 203(k) tied everything to county approvals and started mortgage payments immediately, creating extra pressure.”\n\n- **Loan & Permitting Impact**  \n  - “Because the 203(k) required official plans and approvals, we had to deal with DuPage County’s strict regulations. That drastically increased the time, cost, and scope of work.”\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Permitting & Plan Updates**\n\n- **My Role vs. Architectural Needs**  \n  - “I’m not an architect or permit specialist; I only took this on because your lender required it. We both underestimated how much time, money, and coordination it would take.”\n\n- **Critical Next Steps**  \n  - “We need to finalize plan markups that reflect the actual work (including any structural fixes, fixture counts, materials, etc.). Then we submit those revisions to ALLDRAFT. After that, the county must approve them before any further construction.”\n\n- **Past Inspection Issues**  \n  - “The plumbing inspector spotted pre-existing notches in the joists and required an engineer’s/architect’s solution. We needed to revise the plans, but work still pushed forward—leading to rework and more delays. Let’s avoid that by getting the revisions approved first.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Scope Changes & Budget Strain**\n\n- **Change Orders Not Formalized**  \n  - “We discussed ballpark pricing for new items (extra windows, new layouts, certain materials) but never nailed down exact numbers or updated the payment structure. That caused confusion and financial strain on my end.”\n\n- **Effect on Overall Costs**  \n  - “Every new change affects both time and money. Because we kept adding items without formal change orders, my finances suffered and the budget got murky.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Communication & Boundary Concerns**\n\n- **Contacting Unrelated Parties**  \n  - “Reaching out to my wife and former partner was uncomfortable for them and not appropriate. I understand you wanted updates, but that’s not a standard way to handle a project.”\n\n- **Increased Calls & Personal Stress**  \n  - “When I was sick or unavailable, repeated calls heightened my stress and impacted my health. I’m acknowledging I should have set stricter communication guidelines from the start.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. **My Own Shortcomings**\n\n- **Underestimating Permit Complexity**  \n  - “I didn’t fully anticipate how detailed and time-consuming DuPage County’s process would be. I also struggled to keep up with plan revisions while juggling my personal obligations.”\n\n- **Not Enforcing Boundaries**  \n  - “I should have paused work whenever the scope expanded or permits weren’t clear. I let the project go forward without firm structure, and that added to both our stress.”\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Next Steps & Handoff**\n\n- **Finalizing Plan Modifications**  \n  - “Today’s walkthrough is to confirm exactly what needs to be in the revised plans so ALLDRAFT can update them. We’ll reflect any structural fixes, fixture counts, and code requirements.”\n\n- **Submitting to ALLDRAFT & the County**  \n  - “Once we gather the markups, I’ll submit them to ALLDRAFT. After they finish the revisions, the county must approve. Only after their sign-off should any major work resume.”\n\n- **Removing My Company from Permits**  \n  - “After we submit these updates, it’s best you remove my company from the permits via your lender or the county. You can then hire a new contractor or manage the trades yourself.”\n\n- **Financial Breakdown**  \n  - “I will provide a detailed breakdown of costs so you know what expenses have been covered and what remains.”\n\n- **Communication Going Forward**  \n  - “I ask that any future communication be done via email with Nisar cc’d. If a phone call is absolutely necessary, it should be recorded and include Nisar. This ensures clarity and reduces further stress on everyone.”\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Positive Conclusion**\n\n- **Acknowledge Efforts on Both Sides**  \n  - “I appreciate the effort that’s gone into the house so far.

It outlines **how** to move through each set of issues in a logical order, provides a **flow** for the conversation, and weaves in the talking points as needed. You can treat this like an **agenda** or **roadmap** for your walkthrough, adjusting as you see fit.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Opening & Ground Rules (2-3 minutes)**\n\n1. **Welcome & Context**  \n   - Greet them and set a cooperative tone: “Thanks for meeting with me here. I appreciate your time.”\n   - Establish **why** you’re meeting: “We’re here to finalize what needs to be revised for the plans and make sure we’re all on the same page.”\n\n2. **Structure & Communication**  \n   - Clarify how the meeting will proceed: “I’d like to walk us through each main topic one by one, then open it up for questions.”\n   - Reiterate that **Nisar is present** as a neutral observer/mediator.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Project Background & Financing (3-5 minutes)**\n\n1. **State the Original Vision**  \n   - “We initially planned for a straightforward renovation, but from day one, we knew it would be financed with a 203(k).”\n   - “I cautioned that a 203(k) could bring strict permit requirements and timelines.”\n\n2. **Highlight the Consequences**  \n   - “Because of the 203(k), mortgage payments started before plans were finalized, creating financial pressure to start work earlier than ideal.”\n\n3. **Acknowledge Any Oversights**  \n   - “We both underestimated the time, cost, and complexity tied to DuPage County’s process.”\n\n*(Keep this section concise—just enough to remind them how you got here.)*\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Permit & Plan Approval Sequence (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Recap Past Inspection Issues**  \n   - “When the plumbing inspector saw the pre-existing notches, that triggered the requirement for an engineer’s/architect’s review and revised plans.”\n\n2. **Explain the Plan Requirements**  \n   - “We need the plans to reflect everything: fixture counts, structural details, code updates, etc. Without that, the county can’t give a final approval.”\n\n3. **Explain Why Work Stalled**  \n   - “We did some work before final approval—understandably, because of mortgage pressure—but it led to rework and delays.”\n\n4. **Transition to Today’s Purpose**  \n   - “That’s why today, we’re confirming exactly what must go to ALLDRAFT for plan revisions, so we can hopefully avoid further rework.”\n\n*(This is the core reason you’re all there—make sure it’s clear what the plan update entails.)*\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Scope Changes & Budget Strain (5 minutes)**\n\n1. **Describe the Problem**  \n   - “Each time we changed scope—adding windows, altering layouts, picking different materials—it affected both time and cost.”\n   - “While we discussed ballpark figures, we never formalized the payment structure to match the expanded scope.”\n\n2. **Acknowledge Your Part**  \n   - “I recognize I should have put each change order in writing and adjusted the schedule and budget accordingly, which I didn’t do consistently.”\n\n3. **Outcome**  \n   - “This mismatch led to financial strain on my end, and confusion about what the original payment covered vs. what new work required.”\n\n*(Be clear and factual—no blame, just acknowledgement.)*\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Communication & Boundary Concerns (3-5 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set the Tone**  \n   - “I want to address how our communication went, especially during times I was unavailable or unwell.”\n\n2. **Highlight the Issue**  \n   - “There were multiple follow-up calls when I couldn’t answer immediately, which increased my stress and impacted my health.”\n   - “Contacting my wife and former partner made them uncomfortable; they weren’t part of this project. I should’ve set stricter boundaries, but it still felt inappropriate.”\n\n3. **Moving Forward**  \n   - “Going forward, I’m asking we keep communication to email, with Nisar cc’d, to avoid misunderstandings and reduce stress on all sides.”\n\n*(Offer a clear solution rather than dwelling on the past.)*\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Your Own Shortcomings & Personal Strains (2-3 minutes)**\n\n1. **Acknowledge**  \n   - “I admit I underestimated the workload for the permit process and didn’t enforce boundaries on when work could proceed.”\n   - “I also had personal factors—financial and health—that made consistent oversight challenging.”\n\n2. **Why You’re Stepping Away**  \n   - “Ultimately, the project demands exceeded my capacity. That’s why I’m finalizing these plan revisions and then removing myself from further responsibility.”\n\n*(Briefly convey that you’re taking responsibility, then move on.)*\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Walkthrough of the Property (Practical Component: 10-15+ minutes)**\n\n1. **Physically Inspect Areas**  \n   - “Let’s check the spots where the inspector noted structural concerns, fixture changes, or code issues.”\n   - “As we go, we’ll note exactly what changes must be reflected in the updated plans.”\n\n2. **Marking Up Plans**  \n   - “We’ll gather all these changes and send them to ALLDRAFT so they can prepare a final revision for the county.”\n\n3. **Answer Questions on the Spot**  \n   - If Mirza or Nisar has questions about structural fixes, timing, or code requirements, clarify them now.\n\n*(This is the main action item—getting ready for the plan submission.)*\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Next Steps & Final Handoff (5 minutes)**\n\n1. **Submitting to ALLDRAFT**  \n   - “I’ll compile the notes from this walkthrough and submit the markups to ALLDRAFT. Once that’s done, I’ll be stepping away.”\n\n2. **Removing Your Company from the Permit**  \n   - “Please coordinate with your lender and the county to remove my company from the permits. That way you can hire a new contractor or handle trades directly.”\n\n3. **Financial Breakdown**  \n   - “I’ll provide a cost breakdown separately, showing what’s been covered and what remains. We’ll address any outstanding finances once the updated plans are submitted.”\n\n4. **Communication Protocol**  \n   - “Again, all communications from here on out should be via email, cc’ing Nisar. If a phone call is necessary, it must be recorded with a third party present.”\n\n5. **Encourage a Smooth Transition**  \n   - “I appreciate the work done so far. I hope these steps give you a clear path to finishing the project without further complications.”\n\n---\n\n## 9. **Closing the Meeting (1-2 minutes)**\n\n- **Thank Everyone**  \n  - “Thank you both for meeting. I’ll prepare and send the final plan markups to ALLDRAFT as soon as possible.”\n\n- **Confirm Understanding**  \n  - “Are we all clear on next steps—plan updates, permit changes, and communication going forward?”\n\n- **Offer a Brief Follow-Up**  \n  - “If you have further questions specific to the plan revisions, email me (with Nisar cc’d) so we can address them before I step away entirely.”\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note on Delivery**\n- Keep your **tone calm and professional** throughout.  \n- If disagreements arise, **restate the topic** calmly and **redirect** to the purpose of the meeting (getting the plans finalized).  \n- Avoid assigning blame; emphasize **facts** and **the agreed course of action**.\n\nThis **structured agenda** guides you from **context** to **specific issues** and finally to **practical next steps**. Adapt timing as you see fit, but stick to this sequence to maintain a clear, organized conversation."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"o1","default_model_slug":"o1","parent_id":"dcb969c2-6569-4a77-bc98-762a78859d36","request_id":"9152b1dd2eeff607-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"dcb969c2-6569-4a77-bc98-762a78859d36","children":["fa11693b-2417-40a0-9ae7-3b53858abde3"]},"fa11693b-2417-40a0-9ae7-3b53858abde3":{"id":"fa11693b-2417-40a0-9ae7-3b53858abde3","message":{"id":"fa11693b-2417-40a0-9ae7-3b53858abde3","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740098618.901255,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You have a lot of detail that I told you.

Think of it as a **script** with enough detail to keep you on track, but flexible enough to sound genuine.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Greeting & Purpose**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “Mirza, thanks for meeting today. Nisar, thanks for being here as well. I appreciate both of you taking the time. The main reason we’re here is to walk through the property and make sure we know exactly what needs to be revised on the plans before we send everything back to ALLDRAFT. I want to ensure we’re all on the same page about the next steps and why we’ve ended up in this position.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Sets a **cooperative tone** and clarifies that the purpose of this meeting is about **plan revisions**.  \n- Involves Nisar as a neutral witness from the start.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Recap of the Original Vision & the 203(k) Loan**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “Let’s start by recalling the original idea: a straightforward renovation so you could move in quickly. But once the 203(k) loan came into play, we had these strict permit requirements from DuPage County. I did caution about the 203(k) specifically because I knew it would tie the work to official approvals, but you felt it was the best financing option at the time. Once those mortgage payments kicked in before the plans were finalized, there was immediate financial pressure to keep things moving.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Summarizes how the **203(k) loan** introduced a **strict permitting process** and **financial urgency**.  \n- Acknowledges that **you advised** against it, but **he chose** to move forward.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Permit & Plan Approval Sequence**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “From the moment we knew permits were required, I mentioned I’m not an architect or a permit specialist—I only took on that role because your lender required it. In hindsight, both of us underestimated the amount of time and money it would take for DuPage County to approve everything.  \n- “Then, when the plumbing inspector saw pre-existing notches in the joists, we had to involve a structural engineer. Next thing we knew, we had to revise the plans and submit them again. My recommendation was always to finalize those revised plans before continuing major work, but because of the mortgage payments, we sometimes pushed ahead to keep things moving. That led to rework and more delays.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Explains **why** the approval process got complicated (county requirements, engineering review).  \n- Shows how financial pressure encouraged **starting work prematurely**.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Physical Walkthrough & Marking Up the Plans**\n\n**(You’ll walk around the property now—this is where you point to each relevant area.)**\n\n**You Say (while walking):**  \n- “Let’s look at these joists in person. The plumbing inspector flagged these notches. Normally, I know how to fix that by sistering them, but the county requires an architect or engineer to sign off.  \n- “Over here, we added new windows—so we need to confirm that’s on the revised plans.  \n- “In the bathroom, we changed fixtures—that also needs to match what’s ultimately submitted.  \n- “Basically, every single thing we did—every fixture, every alteration—needs to be reflected so the county has an accurate set of as-built plans.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Ties **visual details** on-site to **plan revisions**.  \n- Reinforces that the **county wants everything official** before final approval.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Scope Changes & Budget Strain**\n\n**You Say (after the walkthrough):**  \n- “One reason we have these budget and timeline issues is because the project scope kept expanding—extra windows, reconfigured layouts, different materials, etc. We usually talked ballpark prices, but I never finalized each change order in writing. That’s on me.  \n- “So even though the actual work was done, the payment structure didn’t keep pace with the new costs. That left me financially strained, given that I was fronting materials and labor at times without clarity on reimbursement.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Acknowledges that **you** contributed to the lack of formalized change orders.  \n- Addresses **why** you fell behind financially and **how** that misalignment added stress.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Communication & Boundaries**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “I also want to address how communication has gone. There were times I was sick or busy, and if I didn’t answer on the first call, the volume of calls would escalate. I get that you needed answers, but it ended up increasing my stress and hurting my health.  \n- “At one point, you reached out to my wife—who felt uncomfortable— and my former business partner, who wasn’t involved in the project. I realize you needed updates, but that’s not a standard professional route. I should’ve set stronger boundaries early on.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- **Acknowledges** you didn’t set strict communication rules but also clarifies **calling your wife** or ex-partner is unacceptable.  \n- Connects repeated phone calls to your **health decline** and stress.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Acknowledging Your Own Shortcomings**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “I want to be transparent: I underestimated how complicated this permitting process would be. I didn’t enforce a strict ‘no work until permits are approved’ rule, because I was trying to accommodate the financial pressure you were under. I also should have formalized each new scope item immediately but got overwhelmed.  \n- “All this meant I couldn’t keep everything moving smoothly while dealing with my personal health and financial constraints.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Shows you **own** your mistakes (lack of boundaries, inability to handle big permit tasks) without dismissing Mirza’s challenges.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Next Steps & Handing Off**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “Let’s confirm the plan from here: We’ll finish marking up everything we saw during this walkthrough—joists, fixtures, windows, any other changes. I’ll submit those notes to ALLDRAFT for revised plans. Once ALLDRAFT finishes, the county still needs to approve those revisions.  \n- “After that, I’m stepping away entirely. You’ll handle any remaining county requirements, and you’ll have to remove my company name from the permits through your lender. You can hire someone new or manage trades yourself, but I can’t continue.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Lays out a **clear finish line** for your involvement: you’re finalizing the plan notes, then **exiting**.\n\n---\n\n## **9. Communication Protocol & Financial Breakdown**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “From now on, I’d like all communication by email, with Nisar cc’d. If a phone call is absolutely necessary, let’s record it and have Nisar on the line. This way, we avoid misunderstandings.  \n- “I’ll prepare a breakdown of costs to date so there’s a transparent record of what’s been covered and what expenses remain. We can handle any final financial matters once the plan updates go in.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- **Formalizes** a new communication approach to prevent more stress or confusion.  \n- Confirms you’ll provide a **cost breakdown** to finalize finances.\n\n---\n\n## **10. Closing & Respectful Conclusion**\n\n**You Say:**  \n- “I appreciate everyone’s time and effort that’s gone into this. I know it hasn’t gone as smoothly as we both hoped, but I’m trying to ensure you have a clear path forward. Once we send these revisions to ALLDRAFT, I’ll be stepping back. Let me know if you have questions specifically about the plan markups, and we can address them by email with Nisar cc’d.”\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \n- Ends on a **professional note**, showing you’re still willing to be cooperative on the plan revisions but are **firm** about your departure afterward.\n\n---\n\n# **Putting It All Together**\n\n1. **Welcome & Purpose** – Start the conversation politely, with a focus on finalizing the plans.  \n2. **203(k) Loan & Project Background** – Explain how the financing forced strict permit requirements and put you on a tight clock.  \n3. **Permit & Plan Details** – Walk through the property, showing where issues arose and why.  \n4. **Scope & Budget** – Discuss how new items or scope expansions happened without a formal structure, impacting finances.  \n5. **Communication Issues** – Acknowledge your part, but stress that calling your wife/ex-partner was inappropriate.  \n6. **Admit Your Own Mistakes** – Show you’re taking responsibility for the lack of enforced boundaries and your underestimation of the process.  \n7. **Outline Final Steps** – Mark up the plans, submit to ALLDRAFT, get county sign-off, then remove your company from the permits.  \n8. **Future Communication** – Insist on email with Nisar cc’d, and phone calls only under specific conditions.  \n9. **Financial Breakdown** – Promise a cost summary to address any outstanding amounts.  \n10. **Close Positively** – Thank them, express hope for a smoother finish under the next arrangement.\n\nUse these **detailed talking points** as a **natural conversation flow**: greet, clarify why you’re here, walk the space, discuss each segment, and wrap up with final steps.

One of the core issues in this project was that **your personal struggles—burnout, stress, health issues, and financial strain—meant that you didn’t have the capacity to maintain the structure and control necessary to keep the project from spiraling.** Instead of stepping back early and protecting your bandwidth, you pushed forward despite clear signs of exhaustion, which left gaps in oversight. Those gaps created opportunities for Mirza Baig to take advantage of the situation, either knowingly or unknowingly, by continually shifting project expectations, pushing for work to move forward prematurely, and disregarding your recommendations.\n\n### **How Burnout Weakened Your Ability to Enforce Boundaries**\nBurnout and personal struggles directly impact **decision-making, patience, and assertiveness**. Instead of enforcing:\n1. **Strict processes for change orders** (formal approvals, locked-in pricing),\n2. **Clear boundaries in communication** (email-only, scheduled calls, no unapproved third-party involvement),\n3. **A structured approach to permitting and inspections** (finalized plans before continuing work),\n\n—you found yourself reacting instead of leading. \n\nEach of these lapses created **opportunities for Mirza Baig to push his own priorities forward**, often at your expense. \n\n### **How Mirza Baig Capitalized on Your Burnout**\n- **Scope creep was introduced, and you didn’t have the energy to push back.**   \n  - He would add windows, move bathrooms, or buy materials outside of the agreed process, and you absorbed the burden instead of insisting on formalizing every change.  \n- **He pressured you to continue work before revised plans were finalized.**  \n  - You **knew** the best course of action was to hold off on further construction until new plans were approved, but because of his financial urgency and **your exhaustion**, you allowed work to progress prematurely to avoid conflict.   \n- **He overstepped professional boundaries.**  \n  - When you didn’t answer immediately, he escalated **volume of calls**, contacted your wife, reached out to your former business partner, and inserted Nisar. Instead of pushing back forcefully and enforcing proper communication methods early on, you let it slide, which **reinforced the pattern of him bypassing your boundaries**.  \n\n### **The Big Picture Takeaway: Lack of Energy = Loss of Authority**\nThis pattern isn’t just about Mirza Baig ignoring you—it’s about how your **burnout made it harder for you to enforce the correct processes**. Because you were struggling personally, you weren’t able to **stay firm** when he pushed in ways that were detrimental to the project.\n\nHad you protected your bandwidth early:\n- **You would have structured and enforced change orders properly.**  \n- **You would have controlled communication flow and prevented escalation.**  \n- **You would have stopped work until all approvals were secured.**  \n\nInstead, by **continuing despite burnout**, you ended up in a **reactive** position rather than a **proactive** one, which left room for Mirza Baig to exert more influence over the project than he should have.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Apply This Moving Forward**\n1. **Recognize when you’re overloaded and step back early.**  \n   - If a project starts feeling like it’s running away from you, **pause, reset boundaries, and restructure responsibilities** before it reaches a breaking point.   \n2. **Enforce strict processes that remove reliance on you.**  \n   - Make approvals **objective**—through signed change orders, email-only communication, and pre-defined project milestones—so the system holds instead of relying on your **real-time energy and oversight**.  \n3. **Communicate clear consequences for overstepping boundaries.**  \n   - Had Mirza known early on that calling your wife or bypassing your instructions would lead to **work stoppage or financial penalties**, he likely wouldn’t have done it.   \n4. **Prioritize your own bandwidth over client urgency.**  \n   - **A client’s financial stress is not your problem**—especially if it’s self-inflicted (like his choice of the 203k loan). Had you **protected your energy and made him own his decisions**, the project wouldn’t have spiraled as it did.   \n\nThis isn’t just about Mirza Baig—this is a **recurring challenge in high-stress projects**. The **lesson here** is that **your ability to enforce structure and process is only as strong as your ability to sustain your own energy and focus.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"55bf677e-7f1e-4560-b702-8f406255c7f6","request_id":"9183295b5a8be81c-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"55bf677e-7f1e-4560-b702-8f406255c7f6","children":["e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635"]},"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635":{"id":"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635","message":{"id":"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740607167.188085,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["What about suggestions that I made and decisions that were ultimately his?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"918336e1a8001497-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e81c113b-d184-4bd5-8631-7fc691740e1a","children":["1d6ffaa8-03a9-4e90-9c1f-7b7853a542ec","fb905b13-f668-44e6-8270-568d7df7e75e"]},"1d6ffaa8-03a9-4e90-9c1f-7b7853a542ec":{"id":"1d6ffaa8-03a9-4e90-9c1f-7b7853a542ec","message":{"id":"1d6ffaa8-03a9-4e90-9c1f-7b7853a542ec","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740607244.309421,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### **Your Suggestions vs. His Decisions: Where the Responsibility Lies**\nOne of the most important takeaways from this situation is that **you provided sound recommendations based on your knowledge and experience, but Mirza Baig made decisions that overrode or disregarded them.** His choices directly contributed to the delays, cost overruns, and stress on both sides. This needs to be **documented clearly, without sounding defensive or assigning blame**, so the record reflects that you were **proactive in advising him**, while he ultimately chose a different path.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Areas Where You Made Recommendations That Were Ignored or Overridden**\nBelow are the **core areas where you advised him correctly**, but he either **chose another path or failed to follow through**, which led to complications:\n\n1. **Loan Structure & Financial Approach**\n   - **Your Recommendation:** Avoid the 203k loan due to its complexity, permit requirements, and rigid structure. Instead, use a hard money lender or personal funds to complete a minimal renovation, move in, then refinance.  \n   - **His Decision:** He **chose to proceed with the 203k loan**, tying the entire project to the **permit process and strict lender requirements**, which led to:\n     - Delays in starting work while waiting for permit approvals.  \n     - Immediate mortgage payments, adding financial strain before work even began.  \n     - Increased oversight from the lender, complicating project flexibility.  \n\n2. **Permit & Plan Approval Sequence**\n   - **Your Recommendation:** Finalize plans **before** starting major work to avoid unnecessary rework.  \n   - **His Decision:** Work began **before all revisions were submitted and approved**, leading to:  \n     - Required structural changes (sistering joists) after plumbing was already installed.  \n     - The need for an architect or engineer to validate repairs, increasing time and cost.  \n     - Multiple rounds of back-and-forth with the county instead of a single, streamlined submission.  \n\n3. **Handling Change Orders & Budgeting**\n   - **Your Recommendation:** Formalize **every change order** before proceeding with additional work, with clear pricing and approval.  \n   - **His Decision:** Changes were introduced informally, and **nothing was finalized in writing**, which led to:  \n     - Completed work exceeding the original budget without a structured payment plan.  \n     - A **disconnect between lender payments and actual project costs**, further straining finances.  \n     - Misalignment between the original contract scope and the evolving work.  \n\n4. **Work Sequence & Rushing Progress**\n   - **Your Recommendation:** Follow a **structured sequence**—get county approval before continuing.  \n   - **His Decision:** He **pushed for work to proceed before necessary approvals**, which resulted in:  \n     - A **framing crew starting work before plans were fully approved**.  \n     - Additional changes required mid-construction, leading to wasted effort.  \n     - More rework than necessary, causing further cost increases.  \n\n5. **Communication & Professional Boundaries**\n   - **Your Recommendation:** Keep communication structured—use email, schedule calls, and keep discussions between **involved parties only**.  \n   - **His Decision:** He escalated pressure and **ignored professional boundaries** by:  \n     - Calling you repeatedly instead of respecting response times.  \n     - Contacting your **wife and former business partner**, which was entirely inappropriate.  \n     - Bringing in third parties without first resolving issues with you.  \n   - This **directly contributed to your stress and burnout**, making it harder for you to stay engaged in the project effectively.  \n\n---\n\n### **How This Should Have Been Addressed Earlier**\nWhile **his decisions were his responsibility**, there were **certain controls that could have been enforced earlier** to prevent these issues. Here’s where **you could have intervened more effectively**:\n\n1. **Refusing to Proceed Until Plans Were Finalized**  \n   - Once it became clear that **permits and approvals were a roadblock**, you could have **paused all work and refused to proceed until finalized plans were in hand**.  \n   - Instead, work continued under pressure from him, leading to unnecessary rework.  \n\n2. **Implementing a Firm Change Order Process**  \n   - A **formalized change order process** should have been implemented **from the start**, requiring:  \n     - All changes to be documented.  \n     - Adjusted pricing to be approved in writing.  \n     - No work to proceed until a revised contract was signed.  \n   - This would have **prevented financial misalignment** and ensured that changes were handled systematically.  \n\n3. **Enforcing Communication Boundaries Early**  \n   - When he **started increasing call volume** or reaching out to others, a **hard boundary should have been set**—all project discussions via email, with calls by appointment only.  \n   - Had this been enforced, it **would have reduced stress and kept the project from escalating emotionally**.  \n\n4. **Holding Him to His Decisions**  \n   - Once he **chose the 203k loan despite your warning**, it should have been made **explicitly clear that any resulting delays, financial strain, or complications were his responsibility**.  \n   - This would have **framed the project from the start as structured under his choices**, rather than letting the pressure fall back onto you.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway: Your Advice Was Sound, But You Needed to Enforce It**\nUltimately, **you made the right calls** at multiple points in the project, but Mirza Baig **chose to go in different directions**, which led to complications. The biggest issue wasn’t that **you didn’t know what needed to happen**—it was that **you allowed work to continue despite knowing that the process wasn’t being followed correctly**.\n\nGoing forward, the **lesson here is not just about making the right recommendations, but about making them enforceable**:\n- **If you say plans must be finalized before work starts, work doesn’t start until then.**  \n- **If you require written approvals for changes, no changes happen without them.**  \n- **If you set communication rules, you cut off any contact that doesn’t follow them.**  \n\nHad these enforcement measures been in place, Mirza Baig **wouldn’t have been able to push work forward prematurely, introduce uncontrolled changes, or escalate stress levels**. This would have left you in **a position of control rather than reaction.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635","request_id":"918333c708841265-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635","children":[]},"fb905b13-f668-44e6-8270-568d7df7e75e":{"id":"fb905b13-f668-44e6-8270-568d7df7e75e","message":{"id":"fb905b13-f668-44e6-8270-568d7df7e75e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1740607398.330578,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### **Your Suggestions vs. His Decisions: Where the Responsibility Lies**\n\nThroughout this project, you made several **informed recommendations** that would have prevented the major issues you both faced. However, **Mirza Baig consistently chose to disregard those suggestions**, leading to **increased costs, delays, and stress**—both for him and for you. The **distinction here** is that while you provided the correct guidance based on your expertise, **he ultimately made the decisions that shaped the outcome**.\n\n#### **Key Suggestions You Made & How He Overrode Them**\n1. **Financing Approach:**\n   - **Your Suggestion:** Avoid the **203k loan** due to its **strict permit requirements, drawn-out approval process, and limitations on work flexibility**. Instead, you recommended **using a hard money lender** or **his own cash** to renovate minimally, move in quickly, and refinance later.\n   - **His Decision:** **Chose the 203k loan**, which **forced** the entire project through **permit approval bottlenecks** and **immediately started mortgage payments** before work could even begin. This choice **created the urgency and financial pressure** that led to many of his later poor decisions.\n\n2. **Permit & Plan Approval Before Work Begins:**\n   - **Your Suggestion:** Finalize **ALL** plans, including structural adjustments and electrical placements, **before starting major work** to avoid **rework, extra costs, and inspection delays**.\n   - **His Decision:** **Pushed to start work prematurely**, despite your warnings, leading to **repeated revisions, additional costs, and the need to redo completed work**. This extended the timeline significantly.\n\n3. **Structured Change Order Process:**\n   - **Your Suggestion:** Implement a **formalized change order system**, ensuring that **every change was approved, priced, and documented** before execution.\n   - **His Decision:** **Introduced changes informally, pushed for work to be done without locking in revised costs, and failed to acknowledge the financial implications**. This **disrupted the original budget and payment schedule**, causing financial strain on both sides.\n\n4. **Communication & Professional Boundaries:**\n   - **Your Suggestion:** Maintain **structured communication** (email, scheduled calls, professional processes).\n   - **His Decision:** **Repeatedly ignored professional boundaries** by:\n     - **Calling excessively when you didn’t answer.**\n     - **Reaching out to third parties (your wife, former business partner, Nisar) instead of handling matters directly.**\n     - **Bypassing proper channels to escalate issues on his own.**\n\n5. **Material Selection & Purchasing:**\n   - **Your Suggestion:** Use **pre-approved materials from your suppliers** to ensure **quality control, availability, and warranty coverage**.\n   - **His Decision:** **Bought materials off Facebook Marketplace**, adding **logistical issues, inconsistencies, and warranty concerns**. This created **unnecessary complications** when those materials ran out or didn’t meet standards.\n\n6. **Inspector's Directions & Structural Fixes:**\n   - **Your Suggestion:** **Sister the joists and submit the repair to the county for approval**—a direct and efficient solution to the inspector’s concern.\n   - **His Decision:** Delayed the process by **pursuing additional input, second-guessing your assessment, and creating unnecessary back-and-forth**. This wasted valuable time.\n\n---\n\n### **The Core Issue: He Didn't Trust the Process You Set in Place**\nWhile Mirza Baig might **believe** he was trying to \"speed things up\" or \"save money,\" the reality is that **his choices continually made things worse.** Instead of following your **well-reasoned, experience-backed plan**, he repeatedly:\n1. **Chose urgency over proper sequencing.**\n2. **Prioritized his short-term financial pressure over long-term project efficiency.**\n3. **Ignored or second-guessed expert guidance, creating unnecessary complications.**\n\nEach time he **overrode your recommendations**, the project became **more chaotic, expensive, and stressful**—both for him and for you.\n\n---\n\n### **What This Means for You Moving Forward**\n**1. Define Clear Boundaries for Client Decision-Making**  \n- If a client **ignores your recommendation**, have a **written agreement** stating that **deviations from your plan are their financial and operational responsibility**.\n- **Example Clause:** \"If the client chooses an alternative course of action against the contractor’s recommendations, any additional time, costs, or rework required due to this decision will be the sole responsibility of the client.\"\n\n**2. Require Written Acknowledgment of Key Decisions**  \n- When a client disregards a major recommendation (e.g., **using a 203k loan, pushing work before permits are approved, or changing materials**), have them **sign off on their decision** with an acknowledgment that **they accept the risks and consequences**.\n\n**3. Don’t Proceed Without Formalized Change Orders**  \n- Even if work **needs to move forward**, **no changes should be made without clear documentation and financial agreement**. This prevents **misalignment and last-minute disputes**.\n\n**4. Maintain Strict Communication Protocols**  \n- Enforce email-only communication for **anything involving scope, cost, or scheduling**.\n- **No personal calls outside scheduled meetings.**\n- **No third-party involvement (e.g., contacting family members).**\n- If someone violates this, issue a **written warning** that continued breaches will lead to contract termination.\n\n**5. Recognize When to Walk Away Earlier**  \n- Had you recognized **the red flags earlier** (e.g., his **pattern of overriding expert recommendations, ignoring processes, and applying financial pressure**), you could have **exited the project at a more natural point before burnout fully set in**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Takeaway: Your Role is to Advise, His Role is to Decide**\nAt the end of the day, **your job was to provide expert recommendations. His job was to make decisions.** The issue wasn’t your guidance—it was his **failure to follow it.**  \n\nMoving forward, the **lesson here is to protect your authority and bandwidth**:\n- If a client doesn't trust your process, **document their choices so responsibility is clear**.\n- Set boundaries **early and strictly**—don’t wait until burnout forces you to enforce them.\n- Don’t allow **financial pressure on their end** to dictate **the integrity of your process**.\n\nThis situation wasn't your fault, but you can **learn from it to prevent similar issues in the future.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635","request_id":"918336e1a8001497-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"regenerate","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."},{"slug":"o1-mini","context":"conversation","reason":"unsupported_targeted_reply","description":"This model doesn't support targeted replies."}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e0302baf-cb6e-48ea-ba66-4601e9335635","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"fb905b13-f668-44e6-8270-568d7df7e75e","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67b60a2d-f7a0-8002-bbd6-cfec795b4163","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[]}
